* Have students self-generate homework assignments. 
    - In pairs, they pick a question to work on. They write up the solutions together, then give it to the rest of the class. 
    
* Project
- find something that interests them
- design a data collection plan
- collect data
- analysis
- report


Updates for next time: 

- Start project in week 2! Big struggles with sampling frame
- Drop functions
- teach spreadsheet data collection methods
- teach long vs wide
- get googlesheets connected to R
- Go in order of book
- less time on theory(?), more time hands on conducting samples and using R
    - except sampling distributions!!!! Do better next time. Do for each type of sampling method?
- notes preparation & shareout worked great, collaborative notes onto website not so much. 
    - add a peer comment feedback portion on shareout? see what i did the first time with the guided commentary. 
- more ownership of homework assignments

# Variability of Estimates

Why do we usually think of a parameter $\mu$ or $p$ as a fixed value, while the sample statistic $\bar{x}$ or $\hat{p}$ as a random variable?


[Zoe, John Paul, Saul]- The parameters are considered a fixed value becasuse every single person in the population of interest is accounted for, and it cannot change. 
The sample statistics are considered variable because with every different random sample that is chosen from the population the sample statistics will change, because only certain people are included in the sample. 



The population paramter is fixed and not changed for the mean. The sample statistcis can vary due to the random variation in the sample data. 



### Example: Enrollment in Graduate Programs in Statistics

* Did everyone get the same sample mean?
* Does your sample mean exactly equal the population mean?
* If you took another sample of 10, would you get the same sample mean? Why?
* If we created a histogram of all our sample means, what would it look like? Where would it be centered at? What is the spread of the histogram?





## Sampling Distribution


* What information might be important to get from a sampling distribution?
[Miguel] - The shape, or the orientation of the distribution. Is the distribution skewed to one side, or does it follow a normal distribution? The shape will help us to visual see where the spread of the sample statistic is primarily located.

[Matthew] Variability: The samplling distribution and standard deviation of the sampling distribution can provide information about the shape of the sample statistic.
[JP] Mean of sampling distribution is probs really close to true population parameter.

* What would happen if we increased our sample size (_not the number of replicates_) to $n=20$ rather than $n=10$. 
[Yazmin]- If we increase the sample size then we'll get a closer value to the true parameter

[Othman] - we would get a more accurate value closer to the true population parameter.
* What about the sampling distribution would change?
[Zoe] the sampling distribution would look more like the parent distribution that represents the population . 
* What would happen if we increased the number of replications (holding $n$ constant) to 1000 instead of 100? What about the sampling distribution would change?
[Saul]  If we increased the number of replications from 100 to 1000 (holding n constant), the distribution of the sample statistic would become clearer.
[Jasmine] - the variability doesn't change


## Bounds on Estimators


### :question: :busts_in_silhouette: Turn & talk

What is the difference between the _error_ and _bias_?




## Confidence Intervals
Consider the following interpretation of the above confidence interval. 

> We can be 95% confident that PhD programs in Statistics have a total enrollment of between `LCL` and  `UCL` students. 

Why is this an incorrect interpretation?

# What is Stratified Sampling (Lohr 3.1)

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
### Motivating Example

Valuating bank assets is a time consuming but critical action needed in the case of a bank failure where the FDIC needs to take over. These assets can be described as 1 of 7 types such as real estate mortgages, commercial loans, and consumer loans.

If we were to take a SRS of all assets from a failed bank to estimate the total dollar amount the FDIC needs to acquire, we could run into a few problems.

-   Consumer loans tend to be smaller on average compared to other types, so the variance of the total could be very large, leading to an imprecise estimate
-   A SRS won't guarantee that items from each of the 7 types of asset categories will be sampled. This would result in undercoverage bias.
:::

It is desirable then to create a sampling design that uses information about the population to improve precision and would prevent a bad (heavily biased) estimate.

If the average value of a variable of interest is different for different subpopulations (e.g. average amount of loans in the 7 different types), then we may be able to obtain a more precise estimate by taking a **stratified** random sample.

### Definition: Stratified Random Sampling

The word *stratify* means to "arrange or deposit in layers". That is to divide the population into $H$ non-overlapping subpopulations called **strata**.

We then draw an independent probability sample (simple random sample) from each strata, then pool the information to obtain overall population estimates.

### Example: Revisiting farmland size

Let's reconsider the estimate for the average number of acres devoted to farms in 1992. Recall that each row in the data set represents a county in the United States. In Example 2.6 we took a 10% SRS from the entire population and looked at the distribution of `farms92`.
:::

```{r}
#| fig-cap: The number of acres devoted to farms in 1992 is very skewed. Most counties have fewer than 500k acres in farms, where some have more than 1.5M acres.
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
agpop <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "agpop.csv"))
set.seed(8126834)
N <- nrow(agpop)
index <- srswor(300,N)
agsrs <- getdata(agpop,index)

ggplot(agsrs, aes(x=acres92)) + geom_histogram()
```

:question: What if this large variance is because counties in the West are physically larger than those in the East? (e.g. LA County is HUGE). The frequency table below confirms that there are many more counties (rows in the data set) from the North Central and Southern compared to from the West or Northeast.

```{r}
table(agpop$region)
```

Instead of taking a 10% sample from the entire population, let's stratify by region first, and then take a 10% sample within region. Review Table and Figure 3.1. What do you notice about the sampled proportion within region, and the sample average and variance within regions?

![](../figs/table_3_1.png)

![](../figs/fig3_1.jpg)

Things to notice:

-   West has highest mean, and highest variance
-   Distribution of acerage is still skewed right within region

## Estimating population parameters

Since a SRS was taken from within each strata, we can use the [same equations](https://sampling-458.netlify.app/notes/formulas.html#simple-random-sample) from SRS to estimate the population parameters for each stratum.

-   Overall Total = sum of within strata totals
-   Variance of the overall total = sum of variances of totals

## Gain from stratification

-   Observations within strata are more similar to each other, than they are to the population as a whole
-   reduction in variance in individual strata can lead to a reduced variance for the population estimate.

::: callout-important
### Definition: Relative gain from stratification

$$
\frac{\hat{Var_{strata}}}{\hat{Var_{SRS}}}
$$
:::

From the Farm example, this ratio was calculated to be 0.75. That means we would only need 0.75\*300 = 225 observations from a stratified sample to obtain the same precision as from a SRS of 300.

> By sampling within strata, we are "borrowing" information from other similar observations.

## closing thoughts

-   Don't have to sample the same % from each strata
    -   Could see a greater reduction in variance with an increased sampling fraction from the West.

# Theory of Stratified Sampling (Lohr 3.2)

## Notation

-   $h=1 \ldots H$ strata
-   strata membership of every unit in the population
-   $y_{hj}$ value of the $j$th unit in strata $h$
-   $\sum_{j=1}^{n_{h}}$ sum of *all* units in strata $h$
-   $\sum_{j}$ sum over the units that were sampled from in strata $h$

| Measure                   | Population $(\theta)$                                                  | Sample $(\hat{\theta})$                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Sample size in strata $h$ | $N_{h}$                                                                | $n_{h}$                                                     |
| Overall sample size       | $N = \sum^{H}_{h=1} N_{h}$                                             | $n = \sum^{H}_{h=1} n_{h}$                                  |
| Total in strata $h$       | $\tau_{h} = \sum_{j=1}^{N_{h}} y_{hj}$                                 | $\hat{\tau}_{h} = N_{h}\bar{y_h}$                           |
| Overall total             | $\tau = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \tau_{h}$                                       | $\hat{\tau}_{str} = \sum_{h=1}^{H}N_{h}\bar{y}_{h}$         |
| Mean in strata $h$        | $\mu_{h} = \frac{\tau_{h}}{N_{h}}$                                     | $\bar{y}_{h} = \frac{1}{n_{h}}\sum_{j} y_{hj}$              |
| Overall mean              | $\mu = \frac{\tau}{N}$                                                 | $\bar{y}_{str} = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \frac{N_{h}}{N}\bar{y}_{h}$ |
| Variance                  | $\sigma_{h}^2 = \frac{1}{N_{h}-1}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{h}}(y_{hj}-\mu_{h})^2$ | $s_{h}^2 = \frac{1}{n_{h}-1}\sum_{j}(y_{hj}-\bar{y}_{h})^2$ |
| Proportion$^*$            | $p = \mu$                                                              | $\hat{p} = \bar{y}$                                         |

-   $\bar{y}_{str}$ is a weighted average of the sample stratum means.

## Bias and variance of estimators 

-   Both are unbiased estimators $E[\bar{y}_{str}] = \mu; E[\hat{\tau}_{str}] = \tau$

-   Variance of the estimator for the total: 
$$
    \hat{V}\big(\hat{\tau}_{str}\big) = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \Big(1 - \frac{n_{h}}{N_{h}}\Big)N^{2}_{h}\frac{s^{2}_{h}}{n_{h}}
$$

-   Variance of the estimator for the mean 
$$
    \hat{V}\big(\bar{y}_{str}\big) = \frac{1}{N^2}\hat{V}\big(\hat{\tau}_{str}\big)
$$

-   Confidence intervals can be calculated as

$$
 \bar{y}_{str} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-H}\sqrt{\hat{V}\big(\bar{y}_{str}\big)}
$$

### Example: Estimate the total number of farm acres in 1992 (Table 3.2)
The best way to understand an equation, is to try to use it to calculate a number. 
:::

1. Import the population data, and the stratified sample that the book authors use. 
```{r}
agpop <- read_csv(here("data", "agpop.csv"))
agstrat <- read_csv(here("data", "agstrat.csv"))
```

To keep my data frame simple, I am going to create a new data set `farm92` that only contains the $y$ value of interest, `acres92`, and the stratification variable `region`. 
```{r}
farm92 <- agstrat %>% select(region, acres92)
```

1. Calculate summary statistics for each region
```{r}
(strata.summary.stats <- farm92 %>% 
   group_by(region) %>% 
   summarize(y.bar.h = mean(acres92),  
             s2.h    = var(acres92),
             n.h     = n()))
```


2. Calculate Population region sizes, add this vector to the data frame created above.
```{r}
(region.size <- agpop %>% group_by(region) %>% tally())
strata.summary.stats$N.h <- region.size$n
strata.summary.stats
```

3. Calculate the sample total $\hat{\tau}_{h} = N_{h}\bar{y_h}$.
```{r}
strata.summary.stats$tau.hat.h <- strata.summary.stats$y.bar.h * strata.summary.stats$N.h
strata.summary.stats
```

4. Calculate the within-strata variance of this total $\Big(1 - \frac{n_{h}}{N_{h}}\Big)N^{2}_{h}\frac{s^{2}_{h}}{n_{h}}$.

```{r}
strata.summary.stats <- strata.summary.stats %>%
  mutate(var.tau.hat.h = 
           (1 - n.h/N.h)*(N.h^2)*(s2.h/n.h)
  )
strata.summary.stats
```

5. Calculate the overall total $\hat{\tau}_{str}$ and variance $\hat{V}\big(\hat{\tau}_{str}\big)$ by summing these values across the strata.
```{r}
(tau.hat.str <- sum(strata.summary.stats$tau.hat.h))
(V.tau.hat.str <- sum(strata.summary.stats$var.tau.hat.h))
```

The estimated total number of acres devoted to farming is `r prettyNum(tau.hat.str, big.mark=",")`, with standard error `r prettyNum(sqrt(V.tau.hat.str), big.mark=",")`. These numbers match those found in Table 3.2.  

We can then use these totals to get $\bar{y}_{str}$ and $\hat{V}\big(\bar{y}_{str}\big)$
```{r}
(y.bar.str <- tau.hat.str / sum(strata.summary.stats$N.h))
(V.y.bar.str <- V.tau.hat.str / (sum(strata.summary.stats$N.h)^2))
```

We estimate the average number of acres devoted to farming per county as `r prettyNum(y.bar.str, big.mark=",")` with standard error `r prettyNum(sqrt(V.y.bar.str), big.mark=",")`. These numbers match those found in the text below Table 3.2.

# Sampling Weights (Lohr 3.3)

* Weights are still the inverse of the inclusion probability, but there may be different inclusion probabilities in different strata. 
    - So weights are not the same for all units
* $w_{hj} = \frac{N_h}{n_h}$
    - This makes sense because $w_{i} = \frac{N}{n}$ in a SRS, and in stratified sampling we do a SRS within each strata $h$. So the weights are the ratio of pop/sample size within strata.

* Estimator for pop'n total can be written as: 
$$
\hat{\tau}_{str} = \sum_{h=1}^{H}\sum_{j}w_{hj}y_{hj}
$$

* Reminder: Sampling weights can be thought of as the number of units in the pop'n represented by each sample member. 

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
### Example Figure 3.2
![](../figs/fig3_2.jpg)
:::

* Stratum 1 has $N_{1}=20$ and $n_{1} = 10$, so each sampled unit counts for 2 population units. 
* Stratum 3 has $N_{3} = 420$ and $n_{3} = 20$, so each sampled unit counts for 21 population units.

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
### Example: Re-Estimate the total number of farm acres in 1992 using sample weights

The weights need to be applied to the individual data points, $y_{jh}$, then all the above calculations can occur again. 

1. Calculate stratum weights
```{r}
strat.weights <- data.frame(
  region = table(agpop$region) %>% names(),
  N.h = table(agpop$region) %>% as.vector(), 
  n.h = table(agstrat$region) %>% as.vector()
)
strat.weights$wt <- strat.weights$N.h / strat.weights$n.h
strat.weights
```

2. Merge those weights back onto the data, joining by region. 
```{r}
agpop <- agpop %>% left_join(strat.weights)
table(agpop$wt)
```

3. Calculate the weighted values $w_{hj}y_{hj}$
```{r}
agpop$wtd.acres92 <- agpop$acres92 * agpop$wt 
```

4. Recalculate weighted mean and variances within strata. Also re-merge the `strat.weights` data back onto this summary so we can calculate the within strata variance. 
```{r}
wt.str.sum.stats <- agpop %>%
   group_by(region) %>% 
   summarize(y.bar.h = mean(wtd.acres92),  
             s2.h    = var(wtd.acres92))

(wt.str.sum.stats <- wt.str.sum.stats %>% left_join(strat.weights) )
```

5. Re-calculate $\hat{\tau}_{h}$ and $\hat{V}(\hat{\tau}_{h})$.
```{r}
wt.str.sum.stats <- wt.str.sum.stats %>% 
    mutate(tau.hat.h = y.bar.h * N.h, 
           var.tau.hat.h = (1 - n.h/N.h)*(N.h^2)*(s2.h/n.h))
```

6. Re-calculate the overall total $\hat{\tau}_{str}$ and variance $\hat{V}\big(\hat{\tau}_{str}\big)$ by summing these values across the strata.
```{r}
(tau.hat.str <- sum(wt.str.sum.stats$tau.hat.h))
(V.tau.hat.str <- sum(wt.str.sum.stats$var.tau.hat.h))
```

> Hmmm..... something isn't right here.

# Selecting a Stratified Random Sample


## Using the `strata` function from the `sampling` package

1. Sort the data by the stratification variable
```{r}
agpop.sorted <- agpop %>% arrange(region)
```

2. Specify the desired within-strata sample sizes $n_{k}$. 
```{r}
n.k <- c(103, 21, 135, 41)
```

3. Create the sampling index of records to select using the `strata` function with arguments specifying the strata names, strata size, and sampling method within strata. 
```{r}
strat.idx <- sampling::strata(data = agpop.sorted, stratanames = "region", 
                    size = n.k, method = "srswor")
```

:warning: Package conflicts can occur with the `strata` function. If it is not working for you, use the `sampling::strata` method of calling the function to ensure you are using the correct version of the `strata` function from the `sampling` package. 

4. Extract the data records that correspond to the sampling index. 
```{r}
ag.str <- getdata(agpop.sorted, strat.idx)
head(ag.str)
```

5. Calculate the sampling weights using the inclusion probabilities (these were created as the variable `Prob` when you used the `strata` function)
```{r}
ag.str$wt <- 1/ag.str$Prob
head(ag.str)
```

5b. Check that the sampling weights sum to the stratum population sizes. 
```{r}
ag.str %>% group_by(region) %>% summarize(sum.wts = sum(wt))
table(agpop.sorted$region)
```

:::{.callout-important}
### Warning
If they do not sum to the stratum population sizes, you have made a mistake somewhere in the calculations for the weights or strata sizes. 
:::

# Computing Statistics from a Stratified Random Sample

## Setup the information for the survey design. 

### Specify weights

We created the weights in the dataset in the the last step. 

### Specify fpc

We need to create a vector of fpc's that are equal to the strata population size. In a SRS, we used `fpc = rep(N,n)`. This create a vector that contains the value `N`, repeated `n` times. In this case, we need to match the strata population size to each record from that strata. 

Option 1: Create a vector that repeats the values in the vector `N.k`, each `n.k` times. 
:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
#### Example
```{r}
ex.N.k <- c(10,25,50) # example population sizes
ex.n.k <- c(2,5,10)   # example strata sizes
rep(ex.N.k, ex.n.k)   
```

The pop size for stratum 1 is repeated twice (the size of the sample from that stratum), the pop size for stratum 2 is repeated 5 times (the sample size for stat stratum) etc. 
:::

```{r}
option1.fpc <- rep(N.k, n.k)
```

Option 2: Merge the pop sizes onto the sample data using `region` as a joining key
```{r}
(pop.strata.sizes <- table(agpop.sorted$region) %>% data.frame())
pop.strata.sizes <- rename(pop.strata.sizes, region = Var1, popsize = Freq)
ag.str.opt2 <- ag.str %>% left_join(pop.strata.sizes)
```

### Call `svydesign`
```{r}
agpop.str.dsgn <- svydesign(id = ~1, strata = ~region, weights = ~wt, 
                            fpc = ~popsize, 
                            # fpc = option1.fpc # This would be Option 1
                            data= ag.str.opt2)
```

## Calculate mean, SE and CI
Note the degrees of freedom for a CI under a stratified sample is $n-H$, which can be extracted from the `svydesign` object using the `degf` function. 

```{r}
(str.total <- svymean(~acres92, agpop.str.dsgn))
confint(str.total, level = .95, df = degf(agpop.str.dsgn))
```

Compare these to our prior "hand" calculated values (and approximate 95% CI): 
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
tau.hat.str
tau.hat.str - 2*sqrt(V.tau.hat.str)
tau.hat.str + 2*sqrt(V.tau.hat.str)
```

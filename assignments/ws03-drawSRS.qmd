2. Choose a numeric variable. For both samples estimate the total, mean, and proportions of variables of your choice with 95% confidence intervals. Interpret each estimate and interval in context of the problem. 


3. Are your estimates generalizable to the entire state? Comment on what assumptions are needed for this to be the case. What other limitations are

The Chicago database of crimes known to police between 2001 and 2019 at https://data.cityofchicago.org/ contained 7,048,107 records. To reduce the size of the data for performing analyses, an SRS of 5,000 records was drawn from the database and saved in file `crimes.csv`. 

a. What is the sampling weight for each record in the sample?

b. What is the estimated percentage of crimes in which an arrest was made? Give a 95% CI.

c. Estimate the total number of burglaries known to police between 2001 and 2019 (use variable `crimetype` to identify the burglaries), along with a 95% CI

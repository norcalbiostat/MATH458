# 1. Discord

Click this link to join the Math & Stats Discord server [https://discord.gg/xCQTAgu8bE](https://discord.gg/xCQTAgu8bE). This is a support platform where student office hours will be held and personalized channels can be made.

## This is the defacto method of communication for this class
I get way too many emails that it's easy to miss one from you. Got questions about an assignment? Need help understanding a code error? Ask here and get help not just from me, but from your classmates as well. This is a collaborative not competitive class.
:::

a. [Download the Desktop app](https://discord.com/download). <span style="color:red">**You should not rely on remembering to log in using the web version.**</span> Chances are very high that you will miss out on important announcements and bonus activities. There also is a Discord phone app that you may want to consider. 
b. Please change your display name to something resembling your name so your classmates (and I) can identify and tag you.
c. Once you join the server and accept the code of conduct, go to the `#class-selection` channel (left side bar) and click the icon that'll add you to our class folder. 
d. Post an introduction in the `#458-class-chat` channel. Include the following:
    * major
    * Any pets (include pics!)
    * what fictional family would you like to belong to? 
    * your biggest concern about the class

# 2. Update your R and R Studio to the latest versions 

* Install the `survey` package
* All homework is to be done in a literate programming/reproducible manner using Quarto (`.qmd`) files compiled to PDF. 
* Make sure you can knit to PDF. If you cannot, then install the `tinytex` package and then run `tinytex::install_tinytex()` in the console to install a lightweight version of LaTeX.
    

# 3. Get Organized

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. 

You need to choose a naming convention for your folders and try to stick with it. Recommended options are: 

* ALL CAPS (MATH458)
* no caps (math458)
* snake_case (math_458) 
* CamelCase (Math458) 

Create this class folder along with the following subfolders to organize your data and script files.

* `data` - any data that's handed out goes in here
* `worksheets` - scripts used for completing worksheets 
* `homework`- assignments to be submitted
* `notes` - you will be writing and contributing notes to the class
* `project` - for project specific files

## Do not let everything live in your downloads folder.
This means when you download a file, right click and "Save as" or "Save target as" and **actively choose** where to download this file.

# 4. Quick access

Bookmark this class website. Going through Canvas every time just is a waste of your time. 
# 5. HackMD

Go to the [What is HackMD collaborative notes](https://hackmd.io/@norcalbiostat/458_intro_hackmd/), read the introduction and add your name and major to the list.




# 7. Programming Assessment 

This is a required, but ungraded pre-assessment of your R programming skills. This allows both of us to have an understanding about where you are at. Instructions for this quiz are found in Canvas.

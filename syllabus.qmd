# Grading Breakdown


# Assignments / graded items 
Your final grade will be a straight sum of points earned and will be displayed as a running total in Canvas. 
I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90%: A, 89-80%: B, 79-70%: C, 69-60%: D, 0-59%: F  


#### Exams (30%)
* 2 Exams (midterm/final, not cumulative). [Error Assessment Form](notes/Analyzing exam errors.pdf) available for midterm. 

#### Homework Assignments (20%)
* Standard homework assignments on the topics listed above. 

#### Worksheets (25%)
* In class worksheets. The intent is to work together and finish them that day, but you'll have until the beginning of the next class period to turn it in. 
* Lowest score dropped. 

#### Notes (20%)
* You will be compiling your own set of notes for this class. This will come in the form of reflective writing, and "fill in the blank" & :star: "You Try It" exercises that are based on the course notes. 
* I will provide you with the blank Quarto (`.qmd`) files that you will fill out in class, compile to PDF and submit for review on a regular basis.

# Class Policies and statements

## Everyone is welcome here

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

-  Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. 
        - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name. 
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).
-   If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email [diversityoffice\@csuchico.edu](mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu){.email}
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

*Adapted from [Monica Linden at Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements)*.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries.


## Attendance

Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason, DM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive. 

* If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms **DO NOT COME TO CLASS**. DM me in Discord we'll make a backup plan. 


## Late work

I don't penalize for late work, but I prioritize on time submissions. If you submit an assignment after i'm done grading everyone elses, and we're moving on to the next topic then your assignment may have to wait a while before I get to it. 

## Collaboration

Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when they have someone else to talk through concepts with. 

:::{.callout-warning}
Collaboration on exams is not allowed.

# University Policies

## COVID-19 

The CSU requires students to be fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 by February 28th, 2022, unless you have an approved exemption. While Chico State has relaxed its stance on mask mandates, for your and my health and safety I _request_ that everyone wear an appropriate face mask covering the nose and mouth while in class. 

## Adding and Dropping the course

You are responsible for understanding the policies and procedures about add/drops, academic renewal, etc., found in the [CSU Chico University Catalog](http://www.csuchico.edu/catalog/). You should be aware of the new deadlines and penalties for adding and dropping classes.

## Confidentiality and Mandatory Reoprting

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. I also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as a your instructor. I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the Counseling and Wellness Center (898-6345) or Safe Place (898-3030). Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related resources are available here: www.csuchico.edu/title-ix.


## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity.

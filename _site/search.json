    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nComplete this checklist in Canvas.\n\n\n\n1. Get Organized\nUsing a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects.\nYou need to choose a naming convention for your folders and try to stick with it. Recommended options are:\n\nALL CAPS (MATH458)\nno caps (math458)\nsnake_case (math_458)\nCamelCase (Math458)\n\nCreate this class folder along with the following subfolders to organize your data and script files.\n\ndata - any data that’s handed out goes in here\nassignments - scripts used for completing worksheets and assignments\nnotes - you will be writing and contributing notes to the class\nproject - for project specific files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not let everything live in your downloads folder.\n\n\n\nThis means when you download a file, right click and “Save as” or “Save target as” and actively choose where to download this file.\nTry this out by downloading the first set of blank course notes that you’ll need for wednesday from here.\n\n\n\n\n2. Discord\nClick this link to join the Math & Stats Discord server https://discord.gg/xCQTAgu8bE. This is a support platform where student office hours will be held and personalized channels can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the defacto method of communication for this class\n\n\n\nI get way too many emails that it’s easy to miss one from you. Got questions about an assignment? Need help understanding a code error? Ask here and get help not just from me, but from your classmates as well. This is a collaborative not competitive class.\n\n\n\nDownload the Desktop app. You should not rely on remembering to log in using the web version. Chances are very high that you will miss out on important announcements and bonus activities. There also is a Discord phone app that you may want to consider.\nPlease change your display name to something resembling your name so your classmates (and I) can identify and tag you.\nOnce you join the server and accept the code of conduct, go to the #class-selection channel (left side bar) and click the icon that’ll add you to our class folder.\nPost an introduction in the #458-class-chat channel. Include the following:\n\nmajor\nAny pets (include pics!)\nwhat fictional family would you like to belong to?\nyour biggest concern about the class\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Get the textbook\nI don’t care if it’s physical or electronic. Having a copy is essential. I have had students use a prior edition, but the page numbers and some content are different. If you go this route be prepared to work with another student to ensure you are looking at the correct content.\nSampling, 3rd Edition. Sharon Lohr\nAlso download the R companion for the book and all data sets from this site as well.\n\n\n4. Read the syllabus\nThoroughly read the syllabus, look over the Canvas classroom and the course website. Then ask at least one question about the logistics or organization of this class in Discord.\n\n\n5. Quick access\nBookmark this class website. Going through Canvas every time just is a waste of your time.\n\n\n6. Update R/R Studio. Demonstrate that you can reender to PDF.\n\nUpdate both R and RStudio to the latest versions https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n(Re)install following packages: tidyverse, survey, sampling, srvyr, googlesheets4, tinytex\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console to install a lightweight version of LaTeX\n\nAll homework is to be done in a literate programming/reproducible manner using Quarto (.qmd) files compiled to PDF.\n\nDemonstrate that you can render a Quarto file to PDF by downloading the Hello Quarto tutorial file\n\nAdd your name as an author in the YAML header in the format author: Your name.\nAdd a code chunk at the bottom of the page with only this code in it: version.\n\nRender to PDF and upload the resulting document to Canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew to Quarto?\n\n\n\nLearn more about Quarto here. You do NOT need to install the quarto package to render files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a refresher on R?\n\n\n\nReview the “R Basics”, and “Reading Data into R” sections of the R Companion for SDA.\n\n\n\n\n7. HackMD\n\nMake an account using your campus email at https://hackmd.io/\nGo to the What is HackMD collaborative notes, read the introduction and add your name to the list.\n\n\n\n8. Help decide office hours\nI would like to try to schedule my open drop in student help hours at a time that works for the majority of students across my classes. Please fill out this form to let me know when you would be able to attend office hours. Mark down a time even if you are only free for part of that time.\nhttps://forms.gle/WNsZU5huMQ3AZnhH6"

Save this into your class folder, remove the _ from the file name, and replace template with your username (e.g. rdonatello). Answer the following questions, compile to PDF and submit to Canvas by the due date. Look closely at your resulting PDF before submitting to make sure that all text, code and output are visible.\n\n\n\nPart I. Key Terms\nChoose 2 items from Exercises 1–31 in the textbook to answer. Include the question text in your assignment.\n\n\nPart II. Survey tool evaluation.\nMany universities ask students to fill out a course evaluation at the end of the term. Chico State has 5 forms that are approved for use in different departments. You can find the list and forms at this link.\n\nWhat procedure is used to distribute and collect these surveys? What are some possible sources of selection bias?\nPick one(1) of the forms and evaluate the questions on this survey against each of the guidelines presented in the textbook chapter 1.5.\nExplain why you think the specific student evaluation that you chose does, or does not, give an accurate measurement of student satisfaction with the course.\nNow consider all five forms. If you only had to give one, which one would you choose and why? Be prepared to defend your answer in class."

    "text": "Collaboration\n\nWith people\n\nA big part of this class is collaborative note creating.\nWe will talk more about being responsible and accountable to each other next week.\n\nCollaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when they have someone else to talk through concepts and debugging with. However your submitted work must represent your personal effort on all parts.\nCollaboration on exams is not allowed.\n\n\n\nWith AI\nAs an instructor I recognize there are a variety of AI programs available to assist in creating text and writing code. However, I want to stress that, AI programs are not a replacement for human creativity, originality, and critical thinking. Writing (text and code) is a skill that you must nurture over time in order to develop your own individual voice, style, and view.\n\nYou are not allowed to use AI to help you write text.\nDon’t immediately turn to Chat GPT to help you figure something out. Ask your classmates first.\nYou can use ChatGPT/AI tools to help you learn, but the work you submit must be your own.\nYou are expected to use the coding functions and style presented in the class.\nThere is no short cut to learning. You must put in effort.\nI reserve the right to assign 0 points on any graded item that I suspect has been written or coded by AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot allowed\n\n\n\n\nWorking with or getting help from others on exams and individual quizzes\nCopying code from another student’s homework and presenting it as your own work.\nCopy/paste from AI tools or internet sources without customization, citation or explanation\nGetting your sibling/friend/colleague to write code for you\nSubmitting any assignment that is not your own personal effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllowed\n\n\n\n\nHelping each other solve homework problems (concepts or code)\nUse AI to help explain a concept or an error message\nCopy/paste code from my course notes (this is actually encouraged!)\n\n\n\nIf at any time I suspect that the work you are submitting is not reflective of your personal knowledge I may ask you to verbally explain a piece of code to me. If your explanation is insufficient may result in a 0 on that assignment.\nAny use outside of this permission constitutes a violation of Chico State’s Integrity Policy and may result in you being reported to the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities."

From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity."

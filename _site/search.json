    "text": "Abstracting your code into many small functions is key for writing nice R code. Many people are initially reluctant to create their own functions. R has many built in functions and you can access many more by installing new packages. So there is no doubt that you are already using functions. This section will show you how to write your own functions.\nWriting a custom function is similar to writing down a mathematical formula with variables. Here is an example function called sum.of.squares which requires two arguments and returns the sum of the squares of these arguments.\n\nsum.of.squares <- function(x,y){\n  x^2 + y^2\n}\n\nOnce you run this code chunk the function is now available, like any of the built in functions within R. Try running sum.of.squares(3,4) in your console.\n\nsum.of.squares(3,4)\n\n[1] 25\n\n\nThe procedure for writing any other functions is similar and involves three key steps:\n\n\nFunctions are defined by code with a specific format:\n\nfunction.name <- function(arg1, arg2, arg3=2, ...){\n  newVar <- sin(arg1) + sin(arg2) # do some useful stuff\n  newVar/ arg3   # the result of the last line is the returned value\n}\n\nTerminology:\n\nfunction.name is the function‚Äôs name. This can be any valid variable name but you should avoid using names that are used elsewhere in R.\narg1,arg2,arg3 are the arguments of the function. You can write a function with any number of arguments. - Arguments are the needed in order to make the function run. For instance, for the sum.of.squares function, x and y are the two arguments because R needs two numbers in order to make the function work.\nFunction body: The function code between the {} brackets is run every time the function is called. This code might be very long or very short.\nReturn value: The last line of code is the value that will be returned by the function.\nLoad the function: For R to be able to execute your function, it needs first to be read into memory. Similar to loading a library, until you do it functions contained within it cannot be called.\n\nTo run a function you highlight the function and run it. Once you run it you don‚Äôt need to run it again.\n\nUsing your function: You can now use your function. You just need to give the proper arguments and the function will return the desired value(s). This may also be called ‚Äúcalling‚Äù your function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚≠ê You try it\n\n\n\nWrite a function that converts degrees Fahrenheit (F) to degrees Celsius (C). The formula for the conversion is \\(C=(F-32)*5/9\\), but recall that F and c are special characters in R and should not be used as variable names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚≠ê You try it\n\n\n\nThe population standard deviation can be computed as follows: \\[\n\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-\\bar{y}\\right)^{2}}{n}}.\n\\]\nWrite a function in R to compute the population standard deviation and use it to compute the standard deviation of \\(x=c(320,50,88,98,215,128)\\)."

The law of large numbers tells us that if we observe a large sample of i.i.d. random variables with finite mean, then the average of these random variables should be close to their true mean. If we can get a computer to produce such a large i.i.d. sample, then we can average the random variables instead of trying to calculate their mean analytically. Simulations can be useful to check assumptions, examine a sampling distribution, or check the validity of the CLT in certain scenarios.\nNotes on the Uniform Distribution https://math350.netlify.app/notes/cn4_5_unif_exp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Finding the mean of a distribution.\n\n\n\nThe mean of the Uniform distribution on the interval [0,1] is known to be 1/2.

    "text": "Why is simulation useful?\nStatistical simulations are used to estimate features of distributions such as means of functions, quantiles, and other features that we cannot compute in closed form. When using a simulation estimator, it is good to compute a measure of how precise the estimator is, in addition to the estimate itself.\nSimulation is a technique that can be used to help shed light on how a complicated system works even if detailed analysis is unavailable. For example, engineers can simulate traffic patterns in the vicinity of a construction project to see what effects various proposed restrictions might have. Statistical simulations are used to estimate probabilistic features of our models that we cannot compute analytically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Server wait time\n\n\n\nTwo servers A and B in a fast food restaurant start serving customers at the same time. They agree to meet for a break after each of them has served 10 customers. Presumably, one of them will finish before the other and have to wait. How long, on average, will one of the servers have to wait for the other?\nSuppose that we model all service times, regardless of the server as a random variable with an exponential distribution with parameter 0.3 customers per minute (\\(Exp(.3)\\)). The time it takes one server to serve 10 customers would follow a gamma distribution with parameters 10 and 0.3 (\\(Gamma(10, .3)\\)).\nLet \\(X\\) be the time it takes \\(A\\) to serve 10 customers, and let \\(Y\\) be the time it takes server \\(B\\) to serve 10 customers. We are asked to compute\n\n\n\nMissing info here\n\nThe most straightforward way of finding this mean analytically would require a two-dimensional integral over the union of two non-rectangular regions.\nOn the other hand, suppose that a computer can provide us with as many independent gamma random variables as we desire. We can then obtain a pair \\((X,Y)\\) and compute \\(Z=|X-Y|\\). We can repeat this process many times and get an average of all the observed \\(Z\\) values.\n\nmissing solution here"

Even if we did a large number of simulations, if we repeated the simulation process we would get slightly different results. This is because a simulator estimator is a random variable. The smaller the simulation variance is the more certain we can be that our estimator is close to the parameter. A measure that is commonly used to judge the uncertainty of simulation is called the simulation standard error.\n\nmissing example or info here? is the simulation SE the SE of the simulated sample?? why should we care and how is it used?"

    "text": "Standard Error\nThe standard error of a statistic is the standard deviation of the sample statistic. It tells us how much the sample statistic will vary from sample to sample. In situations like above where we can examine simulated values of the sample statistic we can estimate the standard error by taking the sample standard deviation of the simulated sample statistics. In other situations we can use mathematical formulas to calculate the standard error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Grad program example cont.\n\n\n\nEstimate the standard error for the mean enrollment in statistics PhD programs for a sample size of 10 and also a sample size of 20.\n\n\nI used the base pipe |> here to pass the results of the replicate function into the sd() function\n\nsd(many.means) #because the example above already had n=10\n\n[1] 10.27937\n\nreplicate(n=100, {\n  my.sample.programs <- sample(stat.phd$FTGradEnrollment, size=20)\n  mean(my.sample.programs)\n}) |> sd()\n\n[1] 7.186622\n\n\nWhen the distributions are relatively symmetric and bell-shaped, the 95% rule tells us that approximately 95% of the data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Applying the 95% rule to sampling distributions, we see that about 95% of the sample statistics will fall within two standard errors of the mean. We use this rule many times to form what we call a 95% confidence interval which gives us a range for which which we are quite confident that captures the true parameter we are trying to estimate.\nWhen using a formula to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval, use \\(2*SE\\) as the margin of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCI for PhD program enrollment\n\n\n\nBased on our example, what would be a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics. Interpret this confidence interval in context of the problem.\n\n\nWrapping the entire line of code in () will execute that code AND print out the results. This lets me see the results in the rendered document AND use the results in the answer sentence using inline code. See the RStudio Help ‚Äì> Markdown Quick Reference for more information.\n\n(LCL <- mean(many.means) - 2*sd(many.means))\n\n[1] 35.62625\n\n(UCL <- mean(many.means) + 2*sd(many.means))\n\n[1] 76.74375\n\n\n\nWe can be 95% confident that the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics is covered by the interval (35.6 , 76.7)."

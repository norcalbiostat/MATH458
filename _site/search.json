The four statistics we are going to compare are: the mean, the midhinge, the trimmed mean and the median.\n\nThe mean. You can use the mean() function here.\n\nThe midhinge, the average of \\(Q_{1}\\) and \\(Q_{3}\\). Use the function you created in worksheet 1.\nThe trimmed mean is the sample mean with a certain percent of the extreme values removed. We will look at a 3% trimmed mean which you can calculate in R with the function mean(x,0.3).\nThe median is the number that divides the sorted data into two equal halves. Use the median() function.\n\nWe will compare the behavior of these statistics by creating sampling distributions of these statistics calculated on samples drawn from a Poisson distribution with known parameter \\(\\lambda\\), using 2 different sample sizes (15, 50) and two different values of \\(\\lambda\\) (0.5, 2). Use 10,000 replications to create your sampling distribution.\nYou should observe a histogram of the generated data to get a feel for the data, but do not need to include copious amounts of plots in your submission.\nFor each simulated sampling distribution, calculate the mean, standard deviation and bias for each of the three statistics under consideration.

The sample mean is sensitive to outliers and therefore we sometimes use other measures of center to estimate the center of a distribution. One such measure is the midhinge which is the average of \\(Q_{1}\\) and \\(Q_{3}\\). The quartiles break up the data into four equal quarters. \\(Q_{1}\\) is the 25th percentile and \\(Q_{3}\\) is the 75th percentile. \n\nCreate a function that computes the midhinge.\nUse your function to compute the midhinge of the numbers: 3,100,40,7,29,2,230,44,100,1200,8,15,900.\n\n\nThe function \\(quantile(x, probs=.25)\\) will return the 25th percentile.

    "text": "Abstracting your code into many small functions is key for writing nice R code. Many people are initially reluctant to create their own functions. R has many built in functions and you can access many more by installing new packages. So there is no doubt that you are already using functions. This section will show you how to write your own functions.\nWriting a custom function is similar to writing down a mathematical formula with variables. Here is an example function called sum.of.squares which requires two arguments and returns the sum of the squares of these arguments.\n\nsum.of.squares <- function(x,y){\n  x^2 + y^2\n}\n\nOnce you run this code chunk the function is now available, like any of the built in functions within R. Try running sum.of.squares(3,4) in your console.\n\nsum.of.squares(3,4)\n\n[1] 25\n\n\nThe procedure for writing any other functions is similar and involves three key steps:\n\nDefine the function\nLoad the function into the R session\nUse the function\n\n\n\nFunctions are defined by code with a specific format:\n\nfunction.name <- function(arg1, arg2, arg3=2, ...){\n  newVar <- sin(arg1) + sin(arg2) # do some useful stuff\n  newVar/ arg3   # the result of the last line is the returned value\n}\n\nTerminology:\n\nfunction.name is the function‚Äôs name. This can be any valid variable name but you should avoid using names that are used elsewhere in R.\narg1,arg2,arg3 are the arguments of the function. You can write a function with any number of arguments. - Arguments are the needed in order to make the function run. For instance, for the sum.of.squares function, x and y are the two arguments because R needs two numbers in order to make the function work.\n\nYou can find out the default arguments for any base R function in the help file.\n\nFunction body: The function code between the {} brackets is run every time the function is called. This code might be very long or very short.\nReturn value: The last line of code is the value that will be returned by the function.\nLoad the function: For R to be able to execute your function, it needs first to be read into memory. Similar to loading a library, until you do it functions contained within it cannot be called.\n\nTo run a function you highlight the function and run it. Once you run it you don‚Äôt need to run it again.\n\nUsing your function: You can now use your function. You just need to give the proper arguments and the function will return the desired value(s).

    "text": "Why is simulation useful?\nStatistical simulations are used to estimate features of distributions such as means of functions, quantiles, and other features that we cannot compute in closed form. When using a simulation estimator, it is good to compute a measure of how precise the estimator is, in addition to the estimate itself.\nSimulation is a technique that can be used to help shed light on how a complicated system works even if detailed analysis is unavailable. For example, engineers can simulate traffic patterns in the vicinity of a construction project to see what effects various proposed restrictions might have. Statistical simulations are used to estimate probabilistic features of our models that we cannot compute analytically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Server wait time\n\n\n\nTwo servers A and B in a fast food restaurant start serving customers at the same time. They agree to meet for a break after each of them has served 10 customers. Presumably, one of them will finish before the other and have to wait. How long, on average, will one of the servers have to wait for the other?\nSuppose that we model all service times, regardless of the server as a random variable with an exponential distribution with parameter 0.3 customers per minute (\\(Exp(.3)\\)). The time it takes one server to serve 10 customers would follow a gamma distribution with parameters 10 and 0.3 (\\(Gamma(10, .3)\\)).\nLet \\(X\\) be the time it takes \\(A\\) to serve 10 customers, and let \\(Y\\) be the time it takes server \\(B\\) to serve 10 customers. We are asked to compute the average difference in times, which is written as\n\n\n\\[\nE(|X-Y|)\n\\]\nThe most straightforward way of finding this mean analytically would require a two-dimensional integral over the union of two non-rectangular regions.\nOn the other hand, a computer can provide us with as many independent gamma random variables as we desire. We can then obtain a pair \\((X,Y)\\) and compute \\(Z=|X-Y|\\). We can repeat this process many times (10000 in the example below) and get an average of all the observed \\(Z\\) values.\n\nX <- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nY <- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nZ <- abs(X-Y)\nmean(Z)\n\n[1] 11.86637"

    "text": "Types of sampling methods\nWe will go into the different types of sampling methods throughout the class, but here are a few.\n\nProbability Sampling\nThe classical formulation of a statistical estimation problem requires that randomness be brought into the sampling plan. With proper randomness in the sampling scheme we can be sure that we have an unbiased estimate and that our statements that involve our confidence in the estimate are accurate. Sampling designs based on planned randomness are called probability samples.\n\n\nSimple random sample\nThere are two types of simple random sampling. One is simple random sampling with replacement, whereby a member of the population can be selected more than once; the other is simple random sampling without replacement,whereby a member of the population can be selected at most once.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, we assume that sampling is done without replacement.\n\n\n\nStratified sampling\nOften deployed when we want to guarantee representation from different groups (strata) in the population. In stratified sampling the population is first divided into subpopulations, called strata, and then sampling is done from each stratum. Ideally the members of the subpopulations should be homogeneous relative to the characteristic under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Would taxpayors support a neighborhood pool?\n\n\n\nFor instance, suppose that a city planner is interested in finding out how his town would feel about a new public pool being built funded by tax payer dollars. He might divide the population up into different income groups such as high, middle, and low incomes. He would then take a simple random sample of individuals within each strata (income group). This would guarantee that his sample had representation from all income groups.\nNote that this type of sampling plan makes use of an auxiliary variable, in this case income. By stratifying we should be increasing the accuracy of our estimate."

    "text": "In this section we review the basic concepts underlying the selection of an estimator of a population parameter, the method for evaluating its goodness, and the concepts involved in interval estimation. Because the bias and the variance of estimators determine their goodness, we need to review the basic ideas concerned with the expectation and variance of a random variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminder: Most people come into this class with different pre-requisite classes and instructors. This recap helps ensure that we are all on the same page with concepts and notation that may be new for some.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical inference centers around using information from a sample to understand what might be true about the entire population of interest. If all we see are the data in the sample, what conclusions can we draw about the population? How sure are we about the accuracy of those conclusions?\nOn April 29, 2011, Prince William married Kate Middleton in London. The Pew Research Center reports that 34% of US adults watched some or all of the royal wedding. How do we know that 34% of all US adults watched? Did anyone ask you if you watched it? In order to know for sure what proportion of US adults watched the wedding, we would need to ask all US adults whether or not they watched. This would be very difficult to do. As we will see, however, we can estimate the population proportion parameter quite accurately with a sample statistic, as long as we use a random sample. In the case of the royal wedding, the estimate is based on a poll using a random sample of 1006 US adults.\n\nStatistical inference: The process of drawing conclusions about the entire population based on the information in the sample.\nParameter: A number that describes the entire population. \\(\\mu\\), \\(p\\), \\(\\tau\\)\nStatistic: A number calculated from a sample. \\(\\bar{x}\\), \\(\\hat{p}\\), \\(\\hat{\\tau}\\).\n\nGenerally our goal is to know the value of the population parameter exactly but this usually isn‚Äôt possible since we usually cannot collect information from the entire population.\nInstead we can select a sample from the population, calculate the quantity of interest for the sample, and use this sample statistic to estimate the value for the whole population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚≠ê You try it\n\n\n\nThe US Census states that 27.5% of US adults who are at least 25 years old have a college bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher. Suppose that in a random sample of \\(n\\)=200 US residents who are 25 or older, 58 of them have a college bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher.\nWhat is the population parameter? What is the sample statistic? Use correct notation for your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Parameter: \\(p = .275\\)\nSample Statistic: \\(\\hat{p} = 58/200 = .29\\)\n\n\n\nThe value of a statistic for a particular sample gives a point estimate of the population parameter. If we only have the one sample and don‚Äôt know the value of the population parameter, this point estimate is our best estimate of the true value of the population parameter.\nAfter we have a little more mathematical terminology and foundation, we‚Äôll come back to what we mean by ‚Äúbest estimate‚Äù, and examine how we can determine if something is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù estimate."

    "text": "The Finite Population Case (Lohr Ch 2.2)\nThe previous section develops results for random sampling from a population considered to be infinite. In such situations, each sampled element has the same chance of being selected and the selections are independent of one another.\n\nMost sampling problems don‚Äôt live in an infinite world, but the population is usually finite although it may be quite large.\nIn addition, we may want to take into consideration varying the probabilities with which the units are sampled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Estimate total number of job openings.\n\n\n\nSuppose, for example, we want to estimate the total number of job openings in a city by sampling industrial firms from within that city. Many of these firms will be small and a few firms will be large. In a random sample of firms, the size of the firm is not taken into account. However, the number of job openings will be directly dependent on the size of the firm. Thus, we might improve the sample if large firms are more likely to be included in the sample.\n\n\n\nSuppose the population consists of the set of elements \\(\\{u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{N}\\}\\) and a sample of \\(n\\) elements is to be selected with replacement independently of one another.\nLet \\(\\{\\delta_{1},\\delta_{2},...,\\delta_{N}\\}\\) represent the respective probabilities of selection for the population elements.\n\n\\(\\delta_{i}\\) is the probability that \\(u_{i}\\) is selected on any one draw.\nfor the case of random sampling with replacement, each \\(\\delta_{i} = 1/N\\)\n\n\n An unbiased estimator of the population total, \\(\\tau\\), is given byNote: The mathematical definition of unbiased is not the same thing as selection biased discussed earlier. The math definition of bias will be discussed below.\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{y_{i}}{\\delta_{i}}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\delta_{i} = 1/N\\), we can rewrite this as\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{y_{i}}{(1/N)} = \\frac{N}{n} \\sum^{n}_{i=1}y_{i} = N\\bar{y}\n\\]\nIt is in the best interest to select the \\(\\delta_{i}\\) values in such a way that the variance is as small as possible. The best practical way to choose the \\(\\delta_{i}\\) is to choose them proportional to a known measurement that is highly correlated with \\(y_{i}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Job openings cont.\n\n\n\nOur universe only consists of these \\(N=4\\) firms: A, B, C and D.\n\n\n\nFirm\nJobs (\\(x\\))\nSize of firm\n\\(\\delta_{i}\\)\n\n\n\n\nA\n3\n70\n70/580\n\n\nB\n10\n90\n90/580\n\n\nC\n25\n120\n120/580\n\n\nD\n61\n300\n300/580\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population total of job openings is \\(\\tau= 99\\). But of course we don‚Äôt know this, so we want to take a sample of \\(n=2\\) firms and count the nubmer of jobs at each firm \\(x\\) as a way to estimate this total.\nIf all firms have equal probability of being selected, then the subset of firms \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) have the same chance of being selected as any other subset of two firms such as \\(\\{A, C\\}\\). However, we may want to select firms with probabilities in proportion to their workforce (\\(\\delta_{i}\\)).\nWithout adjustment the estimate of the total job openings based on the \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) sample would be: \\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = N\\bar{X} = 4*(13/2) = 26\n\\]\nIf we adjust \\(y_{i}\\) based on the probability of selecting firms A and B, \\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big[\\frac{3}{70/580} + \\frac{10}{90/580}\\Big]  = 44.7\n\\]\n‚ùì Was this a good estimate of \\(\\tau\\)? Why or why not?\n\nNo! The population total \\(\\tau\\) is nearly double that of the estimate. However, the weighted mean is much closer to the true value than the unweighted mean is."

    "text": "Abstracting your code into many small functions is key for writing nice R code. Many people are initially reluctant to create their own functions. R has many built in functions and you can access many more by installing new packages. So there is no doubt that you are already using functions. This section will show you how to write your own functions.\nWriting a custom function is similar to writing down a mathematical formula with variables. Here is an example function called sum.of.squares which requires two arguments and returns the sum of the squares of these arguments.\n\nsum.of.squares <- function(x,y){\n  x^2 + y^2\n}\n\nOnce you run this code chunk the function is now available, like any of the built in functions within R. Try running sum.of.squares(3,4) in your console.\n\nsum.of.squares(3,4)\n\n[1] 25\n\n\nThe procedure for writing any other functions is similar and involves three key steps:\n\nDefine the function\nLoad the function into the R session\nUse the function\n\n\n\nFunctions are defined by code with a specific format:\n\nfunction.name <- function(arg1, arg2, arg3=2, ...){\n  newVar <- sin(arg1) + sin(arg2) # do some useful stuff\n  newVar/ arg3   # the result of the last line is the returned value\n}\n\nTerminology:\n\nfunction.name is the function‚Äôs name. This can be any valid variable name but you should avoid using names that are used elsewhere in R.\narg1,arg2,arg3 are the arguments of the function. You can write a function with any number of arguments. - Arguments are the needed in order to make the function run. For instance, for the sum.of.squares function, x and y are the two arguments because R needs two numbers in order to make the function work.\n\nYou can find out the default arguments for any base R function in the help file.\n\nFunction body: The function code between the {} brackets is run every time the function is called. This code might be very long or very short.\nReturn value: The last line of code is the value that will be returned by the function.\nLoad the function: For R to be able to execute your function, it needs first to be read into memory. Similar to loading a library, until you do it functions contained within it cannot be called.\n\nTo run a function you highlight the function and run it. Once you run it you don‚Äôt need to run it again.\n\nUsing your function: You can now use your function. You just need to give the proper arguments and the function will return the desired value(s). This may also be called ‚Äúcalling‚Äù your function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚≠ê You try it. Write functions for the following.\n\n\n\n\nConverts degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.

When using a simulation estimator, it is good to compute a measure of how precise the estimator is, in addition to the estimate itself.\nSimulation is a technique that can be used to help shed light on how a complicated system works even if detailed analysis is unavailable. For example, engineers can simulate traffic patterns in the vicinity of a construction project to see what effects various proposed restrictions might have. Statistical simulations are used to estimate probabilistic features of our models that we cannot compute analytically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Server wait time\n\n\n\nTwo servers A and B in a fast food restaurant start serving customers at the same time. They agree to meet for a break after each of them has served 10 customers. Presumably, one of them will finish before the other and have to wait. How long, on average, will one of the servers have to wait for the other?\nSuppose that we model all service times, regardless of the server as a random variable with an exponential distribution with parameter 0.3 customers per minute (\\(Exp(.3)\\)). The time it takes one server to serve 10 customers would follow a gamma distribution with parameters 10 and 0.3 (\\(Gamma(10, .3)\\)).\nLet \\(X\\) be the time it takes \\(A\\) to serve 10 customers, and let \\(Y\\) be the time it takes server \\(B\\) to serve 10 customers. We are asked to compute the average difference in times, which is written as\n\n\n\\[\nE(|X-Y|)\n\\]\nThe most straightforward way of finding this mean analytically would require a two-dimensional integral over the union of two non-rectangular regions.\nOn the other hand, a computer can provide us with as many independent gamma random variables as we desire. We can then obtain a pair \\((X,Y)\\) and compute \\(Z=|X-Y|\\). We can repeat this process many times (10000 in the example below) and get an average of all the observed \\(Z\\) values.\n\nX <- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nY <- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nZ <- abs(X-Y)\nmean(Z)\n\n[1] 11.74975"

With proper randomness in the sampling scheme we can be sure that we have an unbiased estimate and that our statements that involve our confidence in the estimate are accurate. Sampling designs based on planned randomness are called probability samples.\n\n\nSimple random sample\nThere are two types of simple random sampling. One is simple random sampling with replacement, whereby a member of the population can be selected more than once; the other is simple random sampling without replacement,whereby a member of the population can be selected at most once.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, we assume that sampling is done without replacement.\n\n\n\nStratified sampling\nOften deployed when we want to guarantee representation from different groups (strata) in the population. In stratified sampling the population is first divided into subpopulations, called strata, and then sampling is done from each stratum. Ideally the members of the subpopulations should be homogeneous relative to the characteristic under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Would taxpayors support a neighborhood pool?\n\n\n\nFor instance, suppose that a city planner is interested in finding out how his town would feel about a new public pool being built funded by tax payer dollars. He might divide the population up into different income groups such as high, middle, and low incomes. He would then take a simple random sample of individuals within each strata (income group). This would guarantee that his sample had representation from all income groups.\nNote that this type of sampling plan makes use of an auxiliary variable, in this case income. By stratifying we should be increasing the accuracy of our estimate."

This recap helps ensure that we are all on the same page with concepts and notation that may be new for some.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical inference centers around using information from a sample to understand what might be true about the entire population of interest. If all we see are the data in the sample, what conclusions can we draw about the population? How sure are we about the accuracy of those conclusions?\nOn April 29, 2011, Prince William married Kate Middleton in London. The Pew Research Center reports that 34% of US adults watched some or all of the royal wedding. How do we know that 34% of all US adults watched? Did anyone ask you if you watched it? In order to know for sure what proportion of US adults watched the wedding, we would need to ask all US adults whether or not they watched. This would be very difficult to do. As we will see, however, we can estimate the population proportion parameter quite accurately with a sample statistic, as long as we use a random sample. In the case of the royal wedding, the estimate is based on a poll using a random sample of 1006 US adults.\n\nStatistical inference:\nParameter:\nStatistic:\n\nGenerally our goal is to know the value of the population parameter exactly but this usually isn‚Äôt possible since we usually cannot collect information from the entire population.\nInstead we can select a sample from the population, calculate the quantity of interest for the sample, and use this sample statistic to estimate the value for the whole population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚≠ê You try it\n\n\n\nThe US Census states that 27.5% of US adults who are at least 25 years old have a college bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher.

    "text": "The Finite Population Case (Lohr Ch 2.2)\nThe previous section develops results for random sampling from a population considered to be infinite. In such situations, each sampled element has the same chance of being selected and the selections are independent of one another.\n\nMost sampling problems don‚Äôt live in an infinite world, but the population is usually finite although it may be quite large.\nIn addition, we may want to take into consideration varying the probabilities with which the units are sampled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Estimate total number of job openings.\n\n\n\nSuppose, for example, we want to estimate the total number of job openings in a city by sampling industrial firms from within that city. Many of these firms will be small and a few firms will be large. In a random sample of firms, the size of the firm is not taken into account. However, the number of job openings will be directly dependent on the size of the firm. Thus, we might improve the sample if large firms are more likely to be included in the sample.\n\n\n\nSuppose the population consists of the set of elements \\(\\{u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{N}\\}\\) and a sample of \\(n\\) elements is to be selected with replacement independently of one another.\nLet \\(\\{\\delta_{1},\\delta_{2},...,\\delta_{N}\\}\\) represent the respective probabilities of selection for the population elements.\n\n\\(\\delta_{i}\\) is\nfor the case of random sampling with replacement, each $_{i} = $\n\n\n An unbiased estimator of the population total, \\(\\tau\\), is given byNote: The mathematical definition of unbiased is not the same thing as selection biased discussed earlier. The math definition of bias will be discussed below.\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{y_{i}}{\\delta_{i}}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\delta_{i} = 1/N\\), we can rewrite this as\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{y_{i}}{(1/N)} = \\frac{N}{n} \\sum^{n}_{i=1}y_{i} = N\\bar{y}\n\\]\nIt is in the best interest to select the \\(\\delta_{i}\\) values in such a way that the _______ is as small as possible.

However, we may want to select firms with probabilities in proportion to their workforce (\\(\\delta_{i}\\)).\nWithout adjustment the estimate of the total job openings based on the \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) sample would be:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = N\\bar{X} =\n\\]\nIf we adjust \\(y_{i}\\) based on the probability of selecting firms A and B,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\frac{.}{.}\\Big[\\frac{.}{./.} + \\frac{.}{./.}\\Big]  =\n\\]\n\nreplace the dots with numbers, then delete this line.\n\n‚ùì Was this a good estimate of \\(\\tau\\)?

We use this rule many times to form what we call an approximate 95% confidence interval which gives us a range for which which we are quite confident that captures the true parameter we are trying to estimate.\nWhen using a formula to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval, use \\(2*SE\\) as the margin of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCI for PhD program enrollment\n\n\n\nBased on our example, what would be a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics.

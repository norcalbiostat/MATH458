    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nComplete this checklist in Canvas.\n\n\n\n1. Get Organized\nUsing a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects.\nYou need to choose a naming convention for your folders and try to stick with it. Recommended options are:\n\nALL CAPS (MATH458)\nno caps (math458)\nsnake_case (math_458)\nCamelCase (Math458)\n\nCreate this class folder along with the following subfolders to organize your data and script files.\n\ndata - any data that’s handed out goes in here\nassignments - scripts used for completing worksheets and assignments\nnotes - you will be writing and contributing notes to the class\nproject - for project specific files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not let everything live in your downloads folder.\n\n\n\nThis means when you download a file, right click and “Save as” or “Save target as” and actively choose where to download this file.\n\n\n\n\n2. Discord\nClick this link to join the Math & Stats Discord server https://discord.gg/xCQTAgu8bE. This is a support platform where student office hours will be held and personalized channels can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the defacto method of communication for this class\n\n\n\nI get way too many emails that it’s easy to miss one from you. Got questions about an assignment? Need help understanding a code error? Ask here and get help not just from me, but from your classmates as well. This is a collaborative not competitive class.\n\n\n\nDownload the Desktop app. You should not rely on remembering to log in using the web version. Chances are very high that you will miss out on important announcements and bonus activities. There also is a Discord phone app that you may want to consider.\nPlease change your display name to something resembling your name so your classmates (and I) can identify and tag you.\nOnce you join the server and accept the code of conduct, go to the #class-selection channel (left side bar) and click the icon that’ll add you to our class folder.\nPost an introduction in the #458-class-chat channel. Include the following:\n\nmajor\nAny pets (include pics!)\nwhat fictional family would you like to belong to?\nyour biggest concern about the class\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Get the textbook\nI don’t care if it’s physical or electronic. Having a copy is essential. I have had students use a prior edition, but the page numbers and some content are different. If you go this route be prepared to work with another student to ensure you are looking at the correct content.\nSampling, 3rd Edition. Sharon Lohr\nAlso download the R companion for the book and all data sets from this site as well.\n\n\n4. Read the syllabus\nThoroughly read the syllabus, look over the Canvas classroom and the course website. Then ask at least one question about the logistics or organization of this class in Discord.\n\n\n5. Quick access\nBookmark this class website. Going through Canvas every time just is a waste of your time.\n\n\n6. Update R/R Studio. Demonstrate that you can reender to PDF.\n\nUpdate both R and RStudio to the latest versions https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n(Re)install following packages: tidyverse, survey, sampling, srvyr, googlesheets4, tinytex\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console to install a lightweight version of LaTeX\n\nAll homework is to be done in a literate programming/reproducible manner using Quarto (.qmd) files compiled to PDF.\n\nDemonstrate that you can render a Quarto file to PDF by downloading the Hello Quarto tutorial file\n\nAdd your name as an author in the YAML header in the format author: Your name.\nAdd a code chunk at the bottom of the page with only this code in it: version.\n\nRender to PDF and upload the resulting document to Canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew to Quarto?\n\n\n\nLearn more about Quarto here. You do NOT need to install the quarto package to render files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a refresher on R?\n\n\n\nReview the “R Basics”, and “Reading Data into R” sections of the R Companion for SDA.\n\n\n\n\n7. HackMD\n\nMake an account using your campus email at https://hackmd.io/\nGo to the What is HackMD collaborative notes, read the introduction and add your name to the list."

    "text": "Why is simulation useful?\nStatistical simulations are used to estimate features of distributions such as means of functions, quantiles, and other features that we cannot compute in closed form. When using a simulation estimator, it is good to compute a measure of how precise the estimator is, in addition to the estimate itself.\nSimulation is a technique that can be used to help shed light on how a complicated system works even if detailed analysis is unavailable. For example, engineers can simulate traffic patterns in the vicinity of a construction project to see what effects various proposed restrictions might have. Statistical simulations are used to estimate probabilistic features of our models that we cannot compute analytically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Server wait time\n\n\n\nTwo servers A and B in a fast food restaurant start serving customers at the same time. They agree to meet for a break after each of them has served 10 customers. Presumably, one of them will finish before the other and have to wait. How long, on average, will one of the servers have to wait for the other?\nSuppose that we model all service times, regardless of the server as a random variable with an exponential distribution with parameter 0.3 customers per minute (\\(Exp(.3)\\)). The time it takes one server to serve 10 customers would follow a gamma distribution with parameters 10 and 0.3 (\\(Gamma(10, .3)\\)).\nLet \\(X\\) be the time it takes \\(A\\) to serve 10 customers, and let \\(Y\\) be the time it takes server \\(B\\) to serve 10 customers. We are asked to compute the average difference in times, which is written as\n\n\n\\[\nE(|X-Y|)\n\\]\nThe most straightforward way of finding this mean analytically would require a two-dimensional integral over the union of two non-rectangular regions.\nOn the other hand, a computer can provide us with as many independent gamma random variables as we desire. We can then obtain a pair \\((X,Y)\\) and compute \\(Z=|X-Y|\\). We can repeat this process many times (10000 in the example below) and get an average of all the observed \\(Z\\) values.\n\nX &lt;- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nY &lt;- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nZ &lt;- abs(X-Y)\nmean(Z)\n\n[1] 11.82513"

    "text": "Everyone is welcome here\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nLet me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).\n\nAdapted from Monica Linden at Brown University.\nFurthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries."

People learn better when they have someone else to talk through concepts and debugging with. However your submitted work must represent your personal effort on all parts.\nCollaboration on exams is not allowed.\n\n\n\nWith AI\nAs an instructor I recognize there are a variety of AI programs available to assist in creating text and writing code. However, I want to stress that, AI programs are not a replacement for human creativity, originality, and critical thinking. Writing (text and code) is a skill that you must nurture over time in order to develop your own individual voice, style, and view.\n\nYou are not allowed to use AI to help you write text.\nDon’t immediately turn to Chat GPT to help you figure something out. Ask your classmates first.\nYou can use ChatGPT/AI tools to help you learn, but the work you submit must be your own.\nYou are expected to use the coding functions and style presented in the class.\nThere is no short cut to learning. You must put in effort.\nI reserve the right to assign 0 points on any graded item that I suspect has been written or coded by AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot allowed\n\n\n\n\nWorking with or getting help from others on exams and individual quizzes\nCopying code from another student’s homework and presenting it as your own work.\nCopy/paste from AI tools or internet sources without customization, citation or explanation\nGetting your sibling/friend/colleague to write code for you\nSubmitting any assignment that is not your own personal effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllowed\n\n\n\n\nHelping each other solve homework problems (concepts or code)\nUse AI to help explain a concept or an error message\nCopy/paste code from my course notes (this is actually encouraged!)\n\n\n\nIf at any time I suspect that the work you are submitting is not reflective of your personal knowledge I may ask you to verbally explain a piece of code to me. If your explanation is insufficient may result in a 0 on that assignment.\nAny use outside of this permission constitutes a violation of Chico State’s Integrity Policy and may result in you being reported to the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities."

No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity."

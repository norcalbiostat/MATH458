Working collaboratively as a class, you will design, implement, and analyze an alumni survey to gather valuable insights about their experiences and career paths. This is your chance to apply the sampling and statistical analysis methods you’ve learned in a practical and meaningful way.\nThis project isn’t just about crunching numbers; it’s about teamwork, communication, and project management. As a class you will be responsible for:\n\nDefining Roles & Responsibilities: Assign yourselves specific roles within the project (e.g., survey design team, data analysis team, communication lead).\nTask Management & Timelines: Establish clear timelines and track progress to ensure successful completion of each project phase.\nStakeholder Communication: Get stakeholder (Math Department faculty, Career center) input in the questions being asked.\nDesign & Implementing Multiple Sampling Frameworks: Implement multiple sampling methods (e.g., simple random, stratified, cluster) to select representative samples of alumni.\nData Collection & Analysis: Collect survey responses, clean the data, and perform appropriate statistical analyses to answer key research questions. You will also need to compare estimates obtained across the different sampling frameworks to assess their impact on the results.\nFinal Presentation: Present your findings and recommendations and insights to the Math Department or the assessment committee.\n\nThis is a full class collaborative effort, requiring everyone’s active participation and contribution. Every student should take lead on at least one aspect or activity. Your collective efforts will provide valuable data to inform curriculum development, program improvements, and future initiatives within the Mathematics & Statistics departments. Embrace this opportunity to make a real difference!"

    "section": "Why Use A Stratified Sample?",
    "text": "Why Use A Stratified Sample?\n\nYou can protect against the possibility of a really bad sample with overrepresentation of a subpopulation. Stratified Sampling guarantees set proportions of subpopulations in your sample. Example: You can ensure 50% male and 50% female in a sample.\nStratified sampling means you can know the precision of the data collected for subgroups of the population. Example: comparing experiences of male and female graduates when males vastly outnumber female graduates.\nStratified sampling can be less costly or more convenient. You can use different sampling frames, designs, or field procedures for different strata. Example: You could use mail, email, telephone, or internet surveys based on what works best for each subpopulation\nThis method has lower variance estimates for population means and totals making it more precise than an SRS. This is demonstrated using a motivating example next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotivating Example - Estimating farm details.\n\n\n\nDuring the colonial period of the United States travel was limited and most of the population lived on the East coast. The states are small in size, the population denser, and thus the farmland is smaller. In the 1800’s the US “acquired” the western half of the US in large patches. This led to much larger farmland, owned by fewer individuals.\nThe distribution of farm acreage in 1992 for each region is summarized below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Mutate data to create names for levels and labels in boxplot\nagstrat.plot &lt;- agstrat %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    region_factor = factor(\n      region,\n      levels = c(\"NE\", \"S\", \"NC\", \"W\"),  \n      labels = c(\"Northeast\", \"South\", \"North Central\", \"West\")\n    ),\n    acres_million = acres92/1e6 # convert acres to millions\n  )\n  \nggplot(agstrat.plot, aes(x = region_factor, y = acres_million)) +\n  stat_boxplot(geom = \"errorbar\", linetype = \"solid\", width = 0.5) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 1, outlier.size = 3) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2.5)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\",\n    y = \"Millions of Acres\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Distribution of farm acreage in 1992 by region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nagstrat %&gt;% group_by(region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(sample.average = mean(acres92), \n            sample.variance = var(acres92)) %&gt;%\n  kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nregion\nsample.average\nsample.variance\n\n\n\n\nNC\n300504.16\n29618183543\n\n\nNE\n97629.81\n7647472708\n\n\nS\n211315.04\n53587487856\n\n\nW\n662295.51\n396185950266\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach region has its own box plot we can compare. Each with a marked median (the thick solid line), the 25th and 75th percentiles marked by the edges of the box and its outliers. Each of the regions (except the West) tend to have quite a few high-end outliers (aka positively skewed). The NE region has the smallest average farm size (9.7k acres) and the smallest variance (7.6B) whereas the west has quite a large variance (396B) and mean(622k)\nTo properly estimate the average size of a farm, or the total number of farms, we want to ensure our sample is representative of the population. A SRS may end up oversampling small farms from the east and missing out on larger farms from the west. This is why we considered stratification for this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou try it.\n\n\n\nExplore the distribution of farm acreage in 1982 by region. Create a table of summary statistics and a boxplot. Discuss your findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Estimating the total acerage of farmland.\n\n\n\nThe data contained in agstrat.csv comes from a is stratified sample across four regions of the United States: Northeast, North Central, South, and West.\nUsing this stratified sample, estimate the total number of acres of farmland in the United States in 1992 by calculating the within strata totals, and then combining across strata.\n\n\nSince we took an SRS in each stratum, we estimate the population total within each stratum using \\(\\hat{t} = N\\bar{y}\\) and \\(\\hat{V}(\\hat{\\tau}) = N^{2}\\hat{V}(\\bar{y})=N^{2}(1 - \\frac{n}{N})\\frac{s^{2}}{n}\\) within each strata.\nFor example to estimate the total number of acres devoted to farms in the Northeast,\n\n220*97629.81\n\n[1] 21478558\n\n\nwith estimated variance\n\n220^2*(1-21/220)*(7647472708)/21\n\n[1] 1.594316e+13\n\n\nLohr table 3.2 gives estimates of the total number of farm acres, \\(\\hat{t}_{h}\\), and estimated variance of the total, \\(\\hat{V}(\\hat{t}_{h})\\), for each of the \\(h=4\\) strata. Knowing this is an important key detail that shows us that the overall variance of the estimate is reduced by having the regions broken up into strata. This table also shows that if used efficiently, less samples are needed with stratified sampling to achieve the same, it not better, precision. In regards to the farm acres, this table highlights the variability in sizes of farms and area used for farm land in each stratum."

    "text": "Confidence Intervals\nWhen the distributions are relatively symmetric and bell-shaped, the 95% rule tells us that approximately 95% of the data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Applying the 95% rule to sampling distributions, we see that about 95% of the sample statistics will fall within two standard errors of the mean. We use this rule many times to form what we call an approximate 95% confidence interval which gives us a range for which which we are quite confident that captures the true parameter we are trying to estimate.\nWhen using a formula to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval, use \\(2*SE\\) as the margin of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCI for PhD program enrollment\n\n\n\nBased on our example, what would be a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics.

Be prepared to share out verbally in class.\n\n\n\nTest the questions before administering the survey.\n\nBefore you follow through with the survey, you should test the questions in a smaller sample within the target population to ensure that there is no misintepretation on the questions.\nIn other words, test your questions(for clarity) on a very small sample before conducting a mass scale survey.\n\nKeep it simple and clear\n\nThe idea is the simpler question is easy to give an accurate answer.\nKeep language at a comprehendable level to your audience\nTry to get an answer for one variable/parameter at a time per question\n\nDefine your terms - Be as specific as possible in your language. When there is ambiguity be explicit in what you are asking. Words mean different things to different people; be clear about your meaning. Ex. is a truck a car?\nRelate your questions to the concept of interest.\n\nEnsure questions are directly correlating to what we want to learn, some surveys created mislead information due to the questions being too broad or too specific Example: Testing for income levels and including a question about depression\n\nDecide whether to use open or closed questions\n\nUsing open and closed questions each have their advantages and disadvantages. If you use open questions, the respondent can choose any answer that they feel is appropriate, but there might be some things that don’t come to mind. If you use closed questions, you can give the respondent a few ideas that they might forget about, but they might feel limited to just those options.\n\nPay attention to response option scales - People tend to prefer responding when there is a neutral middle option to use as a reference for describing their opinions. ex: people prefer a five point scale to a six point. What “fairly happy” means is dependent on what the other options are, ie number of options worse or better than that option.\nAvoid questions that prompt or motivate the respondent to answer in a particular way. Avoid “loaded” questions which try to influence the respondent by using very positive or negative words.\n\nEg. “Would you rather increase funding for the music program (like any good community member would), or shut down the school altogether?”\n\nConsider the social desirability of responses to questions, and write questions and use modes that elicit accurate responses. People are more likely to over-report positive activities and under-report negative activities.\n\nEg. Respondents underreporting cigarette use to the question “how many packs do you smoke in a week?”\nEg. “How much money loss to stop gambling in one session?”\n\n(Don’t not) avoid double negatives; they’re needlessly confusing and might cause the respondent to answer in the exact opposite way they intend.\n\nExample from the book: “Do you favor or oppose not allowing drivers to use their cell phones while driving?” The double negative is “do you oppose not allowing…” This could be written as “Do you support or oppose a ban on cellphone use while driving” to alleviate the needless confusion.\n\nInstead of “do you oppose not drilling for oil” should be asked as “do you support drilling for oil?”\nAnother example, not from the book that would be considered confusing is “do you not disagree with this question?”\n\nUse forced-choice rather than agree/disagree questions\n\nPeople answer differently if it’s a yes/no versus a multiple forced-choice option\nExamples from the book include: “Do you agree or disagree with this statement ‘most men are better suited emotionally for politics than are most women’” or “Would you say that most men are better suited emotionally for politics than are most women, that men and women are equally suited, or that women are better suited than men in this area”\n\nInterpretation: What they found was that if it was a yes or no, people tend to lean toward yes if they had less schooling meanwhile if you are given options, a portion of the men that originally said “yes” were now spread across education levels\n\n\nAsk only one concept per question\n\nKeep the questions as simple and straight forward. With two questions someone might agree with one but disagree with the other. The data is then wrong when two questions should of been asked.\nExample: Did you vote for Obama and should healthcare be free.\n\nPay attention to question order effects.\n\nQuestion and answer may affect response to following questions\nEmotionally loaded question may affect following question towards a bias\nTry to ask questions that may be emotionally disconnected from each other\nGovernment spending vs government control"

Avoid selecting a sample that you “feel” is random or representative of the population. These practices can lead to bias and lack of generalizability.\nTo avoid the haphazard nature of “blindly choosing”, or worse looking at what was sampled and changing it because “it doesn’t look random enough”, we use techniques that leverage pseudo-random number generating algorithms."

Pick 3 to answer. \n\nA political poll to estimate the percentage of registered voters in Arizona who approve of the governor’s performance.\nAn e-mail survey of students at your university, to estimate the total amount of money students spend on textbooks in a term.\nA sample of high schools in New York City to estimate the number of schools that offer one or more classes in computer programming.\nA sample of public libraries in California to study the availability and usage of computer resources.\nA survey of fishers visiting a freshwater lake, to learn about which species of fish are preferred.\nAn aerial survey to estimate the number of walrus in the pack ice near Alaska between 173◦ East and 154◦ West longitude.\nA survey of businesses to learn about policies for paid leave.\n\n2.

Find the Expected Value and Variance of \\(t_{str}\\).\nHere is some guidance on an approach:\n\nWrite out all possible SRSs of size 2 from stratum 1, and find the probability of each sample. Do the same for stratum 2.\nCalculate \\(t_j\\) from all possible samples by finding the mean of each combination in the stratum * 4(the amount of values the combination is made from)\nThen assign the probability of observing that each unique \\(t_{j}\\) within each stratum.\nPut these together as a sampling distribution (table or data frame that combines t with p(t)) within each strata\nBased on how \\(t_{str}\\) is calculated, identify all possible values of \\(t_{str}\\), and then the probability of observing those values.\nNow calculate \\(E(t_{str})\\) and \\(V(t_{str})2\\)\n\n3.

We previously used the agpop.csv data for cn03 while studying Simple Random Samples. Now, we’re going to do a similar analysis using stratification. The data file agstrat.csv contains a sample of 300 total farms, stratified by region. It also contains information on different variables.\n1. Assume that the data in agpop.csv is representative of the population. Are the strata in agstrat.csv proportionally allocated? Justify your answer using numbers.\n2. Is stratification doing what it’s supposed to? That is, which allocation provides a more precise estimate?\n3. Draw another stratified sample of 300 total farms from the agpop.csv data. We’ll use the sampling package to do this. Choose an appropriate allocation and justify its use. For each of the following quantities, report an estimate along with its standard error, using the appropriate svy functions.\n\nAverage size of a farm in acres in 1992\nTotal number of acres devoted to farming in 1992\n\n4. Compare your answers with those we found in cn03-srs (don’t worry, they’re listed below) - which sampling plan was better? (Hint: there is code on the course website that can help you out with this)\nIn cn03-srs, we calculated (using a Simple Random Sample):\n\nAverage size of a farm in acres in 1992: 326,732 acres with SE of 21,908 acres.\nTotal number of acres devoted to farming in 1992: 1,005,681,527 acres with SE of 6,743,308 acres.\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Conduct your own stratified survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t take a census!\n\n\n\nRemember to sample from your sampling frame first then only measure the selected items. Use feedback (if present) from the last homework as a guide.\n\n\nTake a small stratified random sample of something you are interested in. The data collection for this exercise should not take a great deal of effort, as you are surrounded by things waiting to be sampled. Some examples: average weights of 1-pound bags of beans or rice from different brands at the supermarket, proportion of unpopped kernels after cooking popcorn from different brands, total number of multi-family housing in different neighborhoods of Chico.\n\nExplain what it is you decide to measure. Be explicit about what parameter you are trying to estimate.\nDefine the following terms for your sample:\n\nTarget population: The broader group you want to make inferences about.\nSampled population: The group you actually have access to.\nStrata: The subgroups within your population that you stratify by.\nObservational unit: The unit on which measurements are taken.\n\nCreate your sampling frame in some type of spreadsheet (google sheets, excel, csv). Describe how you set up this sampling frame, read it into R and show the top few rows using head()\nSet a seed and then use the strata function from the sampling package to generate your sample to be measured. Save this resulting data frame as my_sample and print out the results.\nCollect your data, do your measurements, and record the data in a new variable/vector in the my_sample data set you just generated.\nCalculate the stratum means and variances.\nUsing the svydesign and appropriate svy* functions, calculate BOTH a point estimate and confidence interval for the parameter of interest.\nInterpret your results in a full complete english sentence with point estimate and CI."

Interpret this confidence interval in context of the problem.\n\n\nWrapping the entire line of code in () will execute that code AND print out the results. This lets me see the results in the rendered document AND store the results in an object to call later, like in my sentence response below.\n\n(LCL &lt;- mean(many.means) - 2*sd(many.means))\n\n[1] 32.22691\n\n(UCL &lt;- mean(many.means) + 2*sd(many.means))\n\n[1] 75.29509\n\n\nEvery time I compile these notes, I draw a different sample and will get a different numbers. To avoid conflicts in my written response, and what the code shows, I use inline R code here. See the RStudio Help –&gt; Markdown Quick Reference for more information.\n\nWe can be 95% confident that the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics is covered by the interval (32.2 , 75.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n❓👥 Turn & talk\n\n\n\nConsider the following interpretation of the above confidence interval.\n\nWe can be 95% confident that PhD programs in Statistics have a total enrollment of between 32.2 and 75.3 students.\n\nWhy is this an incorrect interpretation?"

An investigator takes an SRS of classes, and gives each student in the sampled classes a test about function knowledge. The (hypothetical) data are given in the file algebra.csv.\n\nLoad in the data and look at the first few rows. Explain what the values in each column mean.\nPlot the distribution of test score by class. Interpret your graph by comparing the medians, ranges, and variances across classes. What do you notice?\nHow many psus are there? What is the psu with the highest number of ssus? Which one has the least? You must answer this question using R functions such asunique or table. Don’t count this by hand (practice for when you have a billion rows)\nAdd variables containing the weights and the fpc to this data set.\nUsing the proper functions from the survey package, estimate the population average algebra score, with a 95% interval and interpret your interval. Be sure to NOT assume a Z-distribution for this confidence interval but use the degf function to get the proper degrees of freedom out of the survey design object and pass it to the confint function."

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nLet me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist.

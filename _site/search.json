It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nLet me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).\n\nAdapted from Monica Linden at Brown University.\nFurthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries."

    "text": "Guidance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n❓ 👥 Think-pair-share\n\n\n\nUse HackMD to summarize the guidance item assigned to you. Be prepared to share out verbally in class.\n\n\n\nTest the questions before administering the survey.\n\nBefore you follow through with the survey, you should test the questions in a smaller sample within the target population to ensure that there is no misintepretation on the questions.\nIn other words, test your questions(for clarity) on a very small sample before conducting a mass scale survey.\n\nKeep it simple and clear\n\nThe idea is the simpler question is easy to give an accurate answer.\nKeep language at a comprehendable level to your audience\nTry to get an answer for one variable/parameter at a time per question\n\nDefine your terms - Be as specific as possible in your language. When there is ambiguity be explicit in what you are asking. Words mean different things to different people; be clear about your meaning. Ex. is a truck a car?\nRelate your questions to the concept of interest.\n\nEnsure questions are directly correlating to what we want to learn, some surveys created mislead information due to the questions being too broad or too specific Example: Testing for income levels and including a question about depression\n\nDecide whether to use open or closed questions\n\nUsing open and closed questions each have their advantages and disadvantages. If you use open questions, the respondent can choose any answer that they feel is appropriate, but there might be some things that don’t come to mind. If you use closed questions, you can give the respondent a few ideas that they might forget about, but they might feel limited to just those options.\n\nPay attention to response option scales - People tend to prefer responding when there is a neutral middle option to use as a reference for describing their opinions. ex: people prefer a five point scale to a six point. What “fairly happy” means is dependent on what the other options are, ie number of options worse or better than that option.\nAvoid questions that prompt or motivate the respondent to answer in a particular way. Avoid “loaded” questions which try to influence the respondent by using very positive or negative words.\n\nEg. “Would you rather increase funding for the music program (like any good community member would), or shut down the school altogether?”\n\nConsider the social desirability of responses to questions, and write questions and use modes that elicit accurate responses. People are more likely to over-report positive activities and under-report negative activities.\n\nEg. Respondents underreporting cigarette use to the question “how many packs do you smoke in a week?”\nEg. “How much money loss to stop gambling in one session?”\n\n(Don’t not) avoid double negatives; they’re needlessly confusing and might cause the respondent to answer in the exact opposite way they intend.\n\nExample from the book: “Do you favor or oppose not allowing drivers to use their cell phones while driving?” The double negative is “do you oppose not allowing…” This could be written as “Do you support or oppose a ban on cellphone use while driving” to alleviate the needless confusion.\n\nInstead of “do you oppose not drilling for oil” should be asked as “do you support drilling for oil?”\nAnother example, not from the book that would be considered confusing is “do you not disagree with this question?”\n\nUse forced-choice rather than agree/disagree questions\n\nPeople answer differently if it’s a yes/no versus a multiple forced-choice option\nExamples from the book include: “Do you agree or disagree with this statement ‘most men are better suited emotionally for politics than are most women’” or “Would you say that most men are better suited emotionally for politics than are most women, that men and women are equally suited, or that women are better suited than men in this area”\n\nInterpretation: What they found was that if it was a yes or no, people tend to lean toward yes if they had less schooling meanwhile if you are given options, a portion of the men that originally said “yes” were now spread across education levels\n\n\nAsk only one concept per question\n\nKeep the questions as simple and straight forward. With two questions someone might agree with one but disagree with the other. The data is then wrong when two questions should of been asked.\nExample: Did you vote for Obama and should healthcare be free.\n\nPay attention to question order effects.\n\nQuestion and answer may affect response to following questions\nEmotionally loaded question may affect following question towards a bias\nTry to ask questions that may be emotionally disconnected from each other\nGovernment spending vs government control"

    "text": "Sometimes we may need to choose between two sampling plans by comparing measures such as variance, bias and accuracy. Here we are interested in estimating \\(\\mu\\), the population mean.\nFor purposes of studying sampling distributions, assume that all population values are known: \\(y_1 = 98, y_2 = 109, y_3 = 154, y_4=133, y_5 = 190, y_6 = 175\\). Out of the \\(N=6\\) total possible values to sample from, we will choose \\(n=3\\).\nPlan 1: The following eight possible samples may be chosen with equal probability: {1,3,5}, {1,3,6}, {1,4,5}, {1,4,6}, {2,3,5}, {2,3,6}, {2,4,5}, {2,4,6}\nPlan 2: The following three samples may be chosen: {1,4,6}, {2,3,6}, {1,3,5} with respective probabilities \\(\\delta\\) = (.25, .5, .25).\nAnswer the following questions:\na) What is the value of \\(\\mu\\)? \nb) For each sampling plan, find: i)\\(E[\\bar{y}]\\), ii) \\(V[\\bar{y}]\\), iii)\\(\\mbox{Bias}(\\bar{y})\\), iv) \\(MSE(\\bar{y})\\), where \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the mean of sample values.\nc) Which sampling plan do you think is better, and why?"

Working collaboratively as a class, you will design, implement, and analyze an alumni survey to gather valuable insights about their experiences and career paths. This is your chance to apply the sampling and statistical analysis methods you’ve learned in a practical and meaningful way.\nThis project isn’t just about crunching numbers; it’s about teamwork, communication, and project management. As a class you will be responsible for:\n\nDefining Roles & Responsibilities: Assign yourselves specific roles within the project (e.g., survey design team, data analysis team, communication lead).\nTask Management & Timelines: Establish clear timelines and track progress to ensure successful completion of each project phase.\nStakeholder Communication: Get stakeholder (Math Department faculty, Career center) input in the questions being asked.\nDesign & Implementing Multiple Sampling Frameworks: Implement multiple sampling methods (e.g., simple random, stratified, cluster) to select representative samples of alumni.\nData Collection & Analysis: Collect survey responses, clean the data, and perform appropriate statistical analyses to answer key research questions. You will also need to compare estimates obtained across the different sampling frameworks to assess their impact on the results.\nFinal Presentation: Present your findings and recommendations and insights to the Math Department or the assessment committee.\n\nThis is a full class collaborative effort, requiring everyone’s active participation and contribution. Every student should take lead on at least one aspect or activity. Your collective efforts will provide valuable data to inform curriculum development, program improvements, and future initiatives within the Mathematics & Statistics departments. Embrace this opportunity to make a real difference!"

    "text": "1. Discord\nClick this link to join the Math & Stats Discord server https://discord.gg/xCQTAgu8bE. This is a student led support platform where student office hours will be held and personalized channels can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the defacto method of communication for this class\n\n\n\nI get way too many emails that it‚Äôs easy to miss one from you. Got questions about an assignment? Need help understanding a code error? Ask here and get help not just from me, but from your classmates as well. This is a collaborative not competitive class.\n\n\n\nDownload the Desktop app. You should not rely on remembering to log in using the web version. Chances are very high that you will miss out on important announcements and bonus activities. There also is a Discord phone app that you may want to consider.\nYou are welcome to have any username you choose as long as it‚Äôs suitable for school.\nOnce you join the server and accept the code of conduct, go to the #class-selection channel (left side bar) and click the icon that‚Äôll add you to our class folder.\nPost an introduction in the #615-class-chat channel. Include the following:\n\nmajor\nAny pets (include pics!)\nwhat fictional family would you like to belong to?\nyour biggest concern about the class\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n2. HackMD\nGo to the What is HackMD collaborative notes, read the introduction and add your name and major to the list.\n\n\n3. Analysis Software\nInstall your Software Program of Choice (SPC). Here are some choices and thoughts.\n\nR\n\nFree. Installation Instructions available in from the Math 130 webpage\nHarder up front, more powerful in the end.\nSeamless integration with a multitude of other scientific analysis and reproducible reporting mechanisms.\nBecoming much more popular in all scientific fields of study. One of the primary languages for Data Science.\nGoogle at diagram of the tidyverse (a suite of functions in R). Compare it to the images of the data analysis life cycle. What sense do you get?\nNeed some motivation?\n\nhttps://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-you-should-become-a-user-a-brief-introduction-to-r\nhttps://osf.io/j28w7/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn_3N_o2d6Q\n\nOn campus resources\n\nIntroduction to R (MATH 130) 1 unit CR/NC\nData Science Initiative workshops, talks, open drop in analysis time.\n\nOff Campus resources (a few)\n\nChico R Users Meetup Group\nHelp outside of class\nR Examples Repository (This site was also built using R Markdown, is open source and a fabulous example of reproducible research!)\n\n\n\n\nSPSS\n\nPurchase v26 from http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/spss-stats-gradpack for $50 for 6mo rental (2019 prices)\nPoint and click, but can save code and write scripts.\nStand alone program.

Get Organized\nUsing a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for scripts, data, and reports.\nYou need to choose a naming convention for your folders and try to stick with it. Recommended options are:\n\nALL CAPS (MATH615)\nno caps (math615)\nsnake_case (math_615)\nCamelCase (Math615)\n\nCreate this class folder along with the following three subfolders:\n\ndata - your data set and codebook go in here\nscripts - all assignment script files\nreports- assignments to be submitted\n\nYour working directory should now look similar to this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not let everything live in your downloads folder.\n\n\n\nThis means when you download a file, right click and ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù or ‚ÄúSave target as‚Äù and actively choose where to download this file.\n\n\n\n\n5. Poll Everywhere\n\nThe link will always be https://pollev.com/drd\nI have already registered you for Poll Everywhere by connecting it to Blackboard.\nUse your student email to log in and use the password reset link to create a new password. Let me know if you can‚Äôt get registered.\nYou do not need to create more than one PollEverywhere account\nTest out your connection by going to [this link] and answering a question.\n\nNeed additional support? Wildcat Computing Support link: https://www.csuchico.edu/wcs/polleverywhere.shtml\n\n\n6. Textbook\nPurchase the textbook. There has been substantial changes from the 5th edition, so it is not recommended. Format does not matter.\nPractical Multivariate Analysis, 6th ed by Afifi, May, Donatello, Clark.\nThere are at least 3 in the library, and I have a few I can loan out also.\n\n\n7. Student hours\nHelp me find the best time to hold student hours. This will be my time to dedicate to help you you all. These are your hours to get time with me 1:1, to ask additional questions, to get extra help, to just shoot the breeze and hang out.\nFill out this google form to share with me your availability:\n\n\n8. Quick access\n\nBookmark this class website. Going through Blackboard learn every time just is a waste of your time.\nLog into your campus Google Drive and search for ‚ÄúMath 615 F22‚Äù and open this folder.\n\nClick the down arrow between the folder name and the two people icon. Add this folder to your ‚ÄúStarred‚Äù ‚≠ê folder. This will let you find this folder easier"

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nLet me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).\n\nAdapted from Monica Linden at Brown University.\nFurthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries."

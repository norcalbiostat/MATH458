Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nLet me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).\n\nAdapted from Monica Linden at Brown University.\nFurthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries."

    "text": "Why is simulation useful?\nStatistical simulations are used to estimate features of distributions such as means of functions, quantiles, and other features that we cannot compute in closed form. When using a simulation estimator, it is good to compute a measure of how precise the estimator is, in addition to the estimate itself.\nSimulation is a technique that can be used to help shed light on how a complicated system works even if detailed analysis is unavailable. For example, engineers can simulate traffic patterns in the vicinity of a construction project to see what effects various proposed restrictions might have. Statistical simulations are used to estimate probabilistic features of our models that we cannot compute analytically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Server wait time\n\n\n\nTwo servers A and B in a fast food restaurant start serving customers at the same time. They agree to meet for a break after each of them has served 10 customers. Presumably, one of them will finish before the other and have to wait. How long, on average, will one of the servers have to wait for the other?\nSuppose that we model all service times, regardless of the server as a random variable with an exponential distribution with parameter 0.3 customers per minute (\\(Exp(.3)\\)). The time it takes one server to serve 10 customers would follow a gamma distribution with parameters 10 and 0.3 (\\(Gamma(10, .3)\\)).\nLet \\(X\\) be the time it takes \\(A\\) to serve 10 customers, and let \\(Y\\) be the time it takes server \\(B\\) to serve 10 customers. We are asked to compute the average difference in times, which is written as\n\n\n\\[\nE(|X-Y|)\n\\]\nThe most straightforward way of finding this mean analytically would require a two-dimensional integral over the union of two non-rectangular regions.\nOn the other hand, a computer can provide us with as many independent gamma random variables as we desire. We can then obtain a pair \\((X,Y)\\) and compute \\(Z=|X-Y|\\). We can repeat this process many times (10000 in the example below) and get an average of all the observed \\(Z\\) values.\n\nX &lt;- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nY &lt;- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nZ &lt;- abs(X-Y)\nmean(Z)\n\n[1] 11.85117"

Compile (knit/render) this file to PDF, visually confirm all your output and code can be seen and is readable, then submit to Canvas by the due date.\n\nOften we are interested in estimating the center of a distribution. The sample mean is sensitive to outliers and therefore we sometimes use other measures of center to estimate the center of a distribution. One such measure is the midhinge which is the average of \\(Q_{1}\\) and \\(Q_{3}\\). The quartiles break up the data into four equal quarters. \\(Q_{1}\\) is the 25th percentile and \\(Q_{3}\\) is the 75th percentile. The function \\(quantile(x, probs=.25)\\) will return the 25th percentile. See ?quantile for more details.\n\nCreate a function that computes the midhinge.\nUse your function to compute the midhinge of the numbers: 3,100,40,7,29,2,230,44,100,1200,8,15,900.\n\n\nThe function \\(rpois(n,\\lambda)\\) will generate \\(n\\) values from a Poison distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\). See ?rpois for more details.\n\nSuppose I wanted to use the midhinge to estimate the mean of a Poisson distribution, denoted as \\(\\lambda\\). Use your function to calculate the midhinge of a sample of 500 values. Is the midhinge a good estimate of \\(\\lambda\\)? Explain your reasoning.\nThe unknown parameters in simple linear regression are the slope, \\(\\beta_{1}\\), and the intercept, \\(\\beta_{0}\\). The common formula for these estimates are given below.\n\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_{1}=\\frac{\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)y_{i}}{\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}\n\\qquad\n\\hat{\\beta}_{0}=\\bar{y}-\\hat{\\beta}_{1}\\bar{x}\n\\]\nThere are a few ways to do this but using the list() command will do this (i.e. your last line would look something like list(b_0, b_1))\n\nWrite a function in R that computes both the intercept and the slope estimate. Your function will need to return two values.\nTest your code on the following situation. Use your function and compare your estimates to the results when using lm(). In Denali National Park, Alaska, the wolf population is dependent on a large, strong caribou population. In this wild setting, caribou are found in very large herds. It is thought that wolves keep caribou herds strong by helping prevent over-population. Let x represent the number of fall caribou herds and y represent the late winter wolf population in the park. A random sample of recent years gives the following results:\n\n\nx = 31, 34, 27, 25, 17, 23, 20\ny = 75, 85, 75, 60, 48, 60, 60"

    "text": "Types of sampling methods\nWe will go into the different types of sampling methods throughout the class, but here are a few.\n\nProbability Sampling\nThe classical formulation of a statistical estimation problem requires that randomness be brought into the sampling plan. With proper randomness in the sampling scheme we can be sure that we have an unbiased estimate and that our statements that involve our confidence in the estimate are accurate. Sampling designs based on planned randomness are called probability samples.\n\n\nSimple random sample\nThere are two types of simple random sampling. One is simple random sampling with replacement, whereby a member of the population can be selected more than once; the other is simple random sampling without replacement,whereby a member of the population can be selected at most once.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, we assume that sampling is done without replacement.\n\n\n\nStratified sampling\nOften deployed when we want to guarantee representation from different groups (strata) in the population. In stratified sampling the population is first divided into subpopulations, called strata, and then sampling is done from each stratum. Ideally the members of the subpopulations should be homogeneous relative to the characteristic under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Would taxpayors support a neighborhood pool?\n\n\n\nFor instance, suppose that a city planner is interested in finding out how his town would feel about a new public pool being built funded by tax payer dollars. He might divide the population up into different income groups such as high, middle, and low incomes. He would then take a simple random sample of individuals within each strata (income group). This would guarantee that his sample had representation from all income groups.\nNote that this type of sampling plan makes use of an auxiliary variable, in this case income. By stratifying we should be increasing the accuracy of our estimate."

    "text": "The Finite Population Case (Lohr Ch 2.2)\nThe previous section develops results for random sampling from a population considered to be infinite. In such situations, each sampled element has the same chance of being selected and the selections are independent of one another.\n\nMost sampling problems don’t live in an infinite world, but the population is usually finite although it may be quite large.\nIn addition, we may want to take into consideration varying the probabilities with which the units are sampled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Estimate total number of job openings.\n\n\n\nSuppose, for example, we want to estimate the total number of job openings in a city by sampling industrial firms from within that city. Many of these firms will be small and a few firms will be large. In a random sample of firms, the size of the firm is not taken into account. However, the number of job openings will be directly dependent on the size of the firm. Thus, we might improve the sample if large firms are more likely to be included in the sample.\n\n\n\nSuppose the population consists of the set of elements \\(\\{u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{N}\\}\\) and a sample of \\(n\\) elements is to be selected with replacement independently of one another.\nLet \\(\\{\\delta_{1},\\delta_{2},...,\\delta_{N}\\}\\) represent the respective probabilities of selection for the population elements.\n\n\\(\\delta_{i}\\) is the probability that \\(u_{i}\\) is selected on any one draw.\nfor the case of random sampling with replacement, each \\(\\delta_{i} = 1/N\\)\n\n\nNote: The mathematical definition of unbiased is not the same thing as selection biased discussed earlier. The math definition of bias will be discussed below. An unbiased estimator of the population total, \\(\\tau\\), is given by\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{y_{i}}{\\delta_{i}}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\delta_{i} = 1/N\\), we can rewrite this as\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{y_{i}}{(1/N)} = \\frac{N}{n} \\sum^{n}_{i=1}y_{i} = N\\bar{y}\n\\]\nIt is in the best interest to select the \\(\\delta_{i}\\) values in such a way that the variance is as small as possible. The best practical way to choose the \\(\\delta_{i}\\) is to choose them proportional to a known measurement that is highly correlated with \\(y_{i}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Job openings cont.\n\n\n\nOur universe only consists of these \\(N=4\\) firms: A, B, C and D.\n\n\n\nFirm\nJobs (\\(x\\))\nSize of firm\n\\(\\delta_{i}\\)\n\n\n\n\nA\n3\n70\n70/580\n\n\nB\n10\n90\n90/580\n\n\nC\n25\n120\n120/580\n\n\nD\n61\n300\n300/580\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population total of job openings is \\(\\tau= 99\\). But of course we don’t know this, so we want to take a sample of \\(n=2\\) firms and count the nubmer of jobs at each firm \\(x\\) as a way to estimate this total.\nIf all firms have equal probability of being selected, then the subset of firms \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) have the same chance of being selected as any other subset of two firms such as \\(\\{A, C\\}\\). However, we may want to select firms with probabilities in proportion to their workforce (\\(\\delta_{i}\\)).\nWithout adjustment the estimate of the total job openings based on the \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) sample would be: \\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = N\\bar{X} = 4*(13/2) = 26\n\\]\nIf we adjust \\(y_{i}\\) based on the probability of selecting firms A and B, \\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big[\\frac{3}{70/580} + \\frac{10}{90/580}\\Big]  = 44.7\n\\]\n❓ Was this a good estimate of \\(\\tau\\)? Why or why not?\n\nNo! The population total \\(\\tau\\) is nearly double that of the estimate. However, the weighted mean is much closer to the true value than the unweighted mean is."

Applying the 95% rule to sampling distributions, we see that about 95% of the sample statistics will fall within two standard errors of the mean. We use this rule many times to form what we call an approximate 95% confidence interval which gives us a range for which which we are quite confident that captures the true parameter we are trying to estimate.\nWhen using a formula to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval, use \\(2*SE\\) as the margin of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCI for PhD program enrollment\n\n\n\nBased on our example, what would be a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics.

    "text": "Abstracting your code into many small functions is key for writing nice R code. Many people are initially reluctant to create their own functions. R has many built in functions and you can access many more by installing new packages. So there is no doubt that you are already using functions. This section will show you how to write your own functions.\nWriting a custom function is similar to writing down a mathematical formula with variables. Here is an example function called sum.of.squares which requires two arguments and returns the sum of the squares of these arguments.\n\nsum.of.squares &lt;- function(x,y){\n  x^2 + y^2\n}\n\nOnce you run this code chunk the function is now available, like any of the built in functions within R.

    "text": "What is Simulation?\nSimulation is a way to use high-speed computer power to substitute for analytical calculation. The law of large numbers tells us that if we observe a large sample of i.i.d. random variables with finite mean, then the average of these random variables should be close to their true mean. If we can get a computer to produce such a large i.i.d. sample, then we can average the random variables instead of trying to calculate their mean analytically.

    "text": "Why is simulation useful?\nStatistical simulations are used to estimate features of distributions such as means of functions, quantiles, and other features that we cannot compute in closed form. When using a simulation estimator, it is good to compute a measure of how precise the estimator is, in addition to the estimate itself.\nSimulation is a technique that can be used to help shed light on how a complicated system works even if detailed analysis is unavailable. For example, engineers can simulate traffic patterns in the vicinity of a construction project to see what effects various proposed restrictions might have. Statistical simulations are used to estimate probabilistic features of our models that we cannot compute analytically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Server wait time\n\n\n\nTwo servers A and B in a fast food restaurant start serving customers at the same time. They agree to meet for a break after each of them has served 10 customers. Presumably, one of them will finish before the other and have to wait. How long, on average, will one of the servers have to wait for the other?\nSuppose that we model all service times, regardless of the server as a random variable with an exponential distribution with parameter 0.3 customers per minute (\\(Exp(.3)\\)). The time it takes one server to serve 10 customers would follow a gamma distribution with parameters 10 and 0.3 (\\(Gamma(10, .3)\\)).\nLet \\(X\\) be the time it takes \\(A\\) to serve 10 customers, and let \\(Y\\) be the time it takes server \\(B\\) to serve 10 customers. We are asked to compute the average difference in times, which is written as\n\n\n\\[\nE(|X-Y|)\n\\]\nThe most straightforward way of finding this mean analytically would require a two-dimensional integral over the union of two non-rectangular regions.\nOn the other hand, a computer can provide us with as many independent gamma random variables as we desire. We can then obtain a pair \\((X,Y)\\) and compute \\(Z=|X-Y|\\). We can repeat this process many times (10000 in the example below) and get an average of all the observed \\(Z\\) values.\n\nX &lt;- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nY &lt;- rgamma(10000, 10, .3)\nZ &lt;- abs(X-Y)\nmean(Z)\n\n[1] 11.74407"

    "text": "Project Overview: Shaping the Future of Math & Data Science\nThis semester, you will go on a real-world project that will directly impact the future of the Mathematics and Data Science programs at Chico State. Working collaboratively as a class, you will design, implement, and analyze an alumni survey to gather valuable insights about their experiences and career paths. This is your chance to apply the sampling and statistical analysis methods you’ve learned in a practical and meaningful way.\nThis project isn’t just about crunching numbers; it’s about teamwork, communication, and project management. As a class you will be responsible for:\n\nDefining Roles & Responsibilities: Assign yourselves specific roles within the project (e.g., survey design team, data analysis team, communication lead).\nTask Management & Timelines: Establish clear timelines and track progress to ensure successful completion of each project phase.\nStakeholder Communication: Get stakeholder (Math Department faculty, Career center) input in the questions being asked.\nDesign & Implementing Multiple Sampling Frameworks: Implement multiple sampling methods (e.g., simple random, stratified, cluster) to select representative samples of alumni.\nData Collection & Analysis: Collect survey responses, clean the data, and perform appropriate statistical analyses to answer key research questions. You will also need to compare estimates obtained across the different sampling frameworks to assess their impact on the results.\nFinal Presentation: Present your findings and recommendations and insights to the Math Department or the assessment committee.\n\nThis is a full class collaborative effort, requiring everyone’s active participation and contribution. Every student should take lead on at least one aspect or activity. Your collective efforts will provide valuable data to inform curriculum development, program improvements, and future initiatives within the Mathematics & Statistics departments. Embrace this opportunity to make a real difference!\n\n\nMilestones\n\nDefine Project Goals and Stakeholder Input: Documented agreement on the survey’s objectives and how the results will be used, based on input from stakeholders.\nLiterature Review and Best Practices Research: Review of existing alumni surveys and research on best practices in survey design and implementation.\nCreate Sampling Frame: A list of the target population from which the sample will be drawn.\nDevelop & Test Questionnaire: Draft questionnaire, pilot testing, and revisions based on feedback.\nDesign Sampling Strategy: Detailed plan for selecting the sample, including justification for the chosen method and sample size calculations.\nCollect Data: Completed survey responses. Include metrics on response rate and efforts to address non-response bias.\nData Cleaning: Prepare the data for analysis. Screen for outliers, missing or invalid responses. Create necessary metrics. Create basic tables and summaries for each measures.\nData Analysis: Create analysis plan, conduct analysis and compile results, create visualizations.\nFinal Presentation: Presentation to stakeholders\nFinal Report: Comprehensive written report documenting all aspects of the project."

Applying the 95% rule to sampling distributions, we see that about 95% of the sample statistics will fall within two standard errors of the mean. We use this rule many times to form what we call an approximate 95% confidence interval which gives us a range for which which we are quite confident that captures the true parameter we are trying to estimate.\nWhen using a formula to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval, use \\(2*SE\\) as the margin of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCI for PhD program enrollment\n\n\n\nBased on our example, what would be a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics.

Get Organized\nUsing a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects.\nYou need to choose a naming convention for your folders and try to stick with it. Recommended options are:\n\nALL CAPS (MATH458)\nno caps (math458)\nsnake_case (math_458)\nCamelCase (Math458)\n\nCreate this class folder along with the following subfolders to organize your data and script files.\n\ndata - any data that’s handed out goes in here\nassignments - scripts used for completing worksheets and assignments\nnotes - you will be writing and contributing notes to the class\nproject - for project specific files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not let everything live in your downloads folder.\n\n\n\nThis means when you download a file, right click and “Save as” or “Save target as” and actively choose where to download this file.\nTry this out by downloading the first set of blank course notes that you’ll need for wednesday from here.\n\n\n\n\n2. Discord\nClick this link to join the Math & Stats Discord server https://discord.gg/xCQTAgu8bE. This is a support platform where student office hours will be held and personalized channels can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the defacto method of communication for this class\n\n\n\nI get way too many emails that it’s easy to miss one from you. Got questions about an assignment? Need help understanding a code error? Ask here and get help not just from me, but from your classmates as well. This is a collaborative not competitive class.\n\n\n\nDownload the Desktop app. You should not rely on remembering to log in using the web version. Chances are very high that you will miss out on important announcements and bonus activities. There also is a Discord phone app that you may want to consider.\nPlease change your display name to something resembling your name so your classmates (and I) can identify and tag you.\nOnce you join the server and accept the code of conduct, go to the #class-selection channel (left side bar) and click the icon that’ll add you to our class folder.\nPost an introduction in the #458-class-chat channel. Include the following:\n\nmajor\nAny pets (include pics!)\nwhat fictional family would you like to belong to?\nyour biggest concern about the class\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Get the textbook\nI don’t care if it’s physical or electronic. Having a copy is essential. I have had students use a prior edition, but the page numbers and some content are different. If you go this route be prepared to work with another student to ensure you are looking at the correct content.\nSampling, 3rd Edition. Sharon Lohr\nAlso download the R companion for the book and all data sets from this site as well.\n\n\n4. Read the syllabus\nThoroughly read the syllabus, look over the Canvas classroom and the course website. Then ask at least one question about the logistics or organization of this class in Discord.\n\n\n5. Quick access\nBookmark this class website. Going through Canvas every time just is a waste of your time.\n\n\n6. Update R/R Studio. Demonstrate that you can reender to PDF.\n\nUpdate both R and RStudio to the latest versions https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n(Re)install following packages: tidyverse, survey, sampling, srvyr, googlesheets4, tinytex\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console to install a lightweight version of LaTeX\n\nAll homework is to be done in a literate programming/reproducible manner using Quarto (.qmd) files compiled to PDF.\n\nDemonstrate that you can render a Quarto file to PDF by downloading the Hello Quarto tutorial file\n\nAdd your name as an author in the YAML header in the format author: Your name.\nAdd a code chunk at the bottom of the page with only this code in it: version.\n\nRender to PDF and upload the resulting document to Canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew to Quarto?\n\n\n\nLearn more about Quarto here. You do NOT need to install the quarto package to render files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a refresher on R?\n\n\n\nReview the “R Basics”, and “Reading Data into R” sections of the R Companion for SDA.\n\n\n\n\n7. HackMD\n\nMake an account using your campus email at https://hackmd.io/\nGo to the What is HackMD collaborative notes, read the introduction and add your name to the list.\n\n\n\n8. Help decide office hours\nI would like to try to schedule my open drop in student help hours at a time that works for the majority of students across my classes. Please fill out this form to let me know when you would be able to attend office hours. Mark down a time even if you are only free for part of that time.\nhttps://forms.gle/WNsZU5huMQ3AZnhH6"

    "text": "Guidance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n❓ 👥 Think-pair-share\n\n\n\nUse HackMD to summarize the guidance item assigned to you. Be prepared to share out verbally in class.\n\n\n\nTest the questions before administering the survey.\n\nBefore you follow through with the survey, you should test the questions in a smaller sample within the target population to ensure that there is no misintepretation on the questions.\nIn other words, test your questions(for clarity) on a very small sample before conducting a mass scale survey.\n\nKeep it simple and clear\n\nThe idea is the simpler question is easy to give an accurate answer.\nKeep language at a comprehendable level to your audience\nTry to get an answer for one variable/parameter at a time per question\n\nDefine your terms - Be as specific as possible in your language. When there is ambiguity be explicit in what you are asking. Words mean different things to different people; be clear about your meaning. Ex. is a truck a car?\nRelate your questions to the concept of interest.\n\nEnsure questions are directly correlating to what we want to learn, some surveys created mislead information due to the questions being too broad or too specific Example: Testing for income levels and including a question about depression\n\nDecide whether to use open or closed questions\n\nUsing open and closed questions each have their advantages and disadvantages. If you use open questions, the respondent can choose any answer that they feel is appropriate, but there might be some things that don’t come to mind. If you use closed questions, you can give the respondent a few ideas that they might forget about, but they might feel limited to just those options.\n\nPay attention to response option scales - People tend to prefer responding when there is a neutral middle option to use as a reference for describing their opinions. ex: people prefer a five point scale to a six point. What “fairly happy” means is dependent on what the other options are, ie number of options worse or better than that option.\nAvoid questions that prompt or motivate the respondent to answer in a particular way. Avoid “loaded” questions which try to influence the respondent by using very positive or negative words.\n\nEg. “Would you rather increase funding for the music program (like any good community member would), or shut down the school altogether?”\n\nConsider the social desirability of responses to questions, and write questions and use modes that elicit accurate responses. People are more likely to over-report positive activities and under-report negative activities.\n\nEg. Respondents underreporting cigarette use to the question “how many packs do you smoke in a week?”\nEg. “How much money loss to stop gambling in one session?”\n\n(Don’t not) avoid double negatives; they’re needlessly confusing and might cause the respondent to answer in the exact opposite way they intend.\n\nExample from the book: “Do you favor or oppose not allowing drivers to use their cell phones while driving?” The double negative is “do you oppose not allowing…” This could be written as “Do you support or oppose a ban on cellphone use while driving” to alleviate the needless confusion.\n\nInstead of “do you oppose not drilling for oil” should be asked as “do you support drilling for oil?”\nAnother example, not from the book that would be considered confusing is “do you not disagree with this question?”\n\nUse forced-choice rather than agree/disagree questions\n\nPeople answer differently if it’s a yes/no versus a multiple forced-choice option\nExamples from the book include: “Do you agree or disagree with this statement ‘most men are better suited emotionally for politics than are most women’” or “Would you say that most men are better suited emotionally for politics than are most women, that men and women are equally suited, or that women are better suited than men in this area”\n\nInterpretation: What they found was that if it was a yes or no, people tend to lean toward yes if they had less schooling meanwhile if you are given options, a portion of the men that originally said “yes” were now spread across education levels\n\n\nAsk only one concept per question\n\nKeep the questions as simple and straight forward. With two questions someone might agree with one but disagree with the other. The data is then wrong when two questions should of been asked.\nExample: Did you vote for Obama and should healthcare be free.\n\nPay attention to question order effects.\n\nQuestion and answer may affect response to following questions\nEmotionally loaded question may affect following question towards a bias\nTry to ask questions that may be emotionally disconnected from each other\nGovernment spending vs government control"

    "text": "Confidence Intervals\nWhen the distributions are relatively symmetric and bell-shaped, the 95% rule tells us that approximately 95% of the data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Applying the 95% rule to sampling distributions, we see that about 95% of the sample statistics will fall within two standard errors of the mean. We use this rule many times to form what we call an approximate 95% confidence interval which gives us a range for which which we are quite confident that captures the true parameter we are trying to estimate.\nWhen using a formula to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval, use \\(2*SE\\) as the margin of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCI for PhD program enrollment\n\n\n\nBased on our example, what would be a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics.

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nAcademic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity."

We are interested in estimating $\\mu$, the population mean.\n\nLet $N=6$ and $n=3$. For purposes of studying sampling distributions, assume that all population values are known:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- c(98, 109, 154, 133, 190, 175)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Plan 1**: The following eight possible samples may be chosen with equal probability: {1,3,5}, {1,3,6}, {1,4,5}, {1,4,6}, {2,3,5}, {2,3,6}, {2,4,5}, {2,4,6}\n\n**Plan 2**: The following three samples may be chosen: {1,4,6}, {2,3,6}, {1,3,5} with respective probabilities $\\delta$ = (.25, .5, .25). \n\nAnswer the following questions: \n\n**a) What is the value of $\\mu$? **\n\n\n**b) For each sampling plan, find: i)$E[\\bar{y}]$, ii) $V[\\bar{y}]$, iii)$\\mbox{Bias}(\\bar{y})$, iv) $MSE(\\bar{y})$, where $\\bar{y}$ is the mean of sample values.**\n\n\n**c) Which sampling plan do you think is better, and why?**\n\n\n\n",

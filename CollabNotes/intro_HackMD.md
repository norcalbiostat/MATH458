# What is Hack MD? 

> Best way to write and share your knowledge in Markdown

# What is Markdown? 

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats...most commonly for this class is HTML.


e.g. a way to turn almost plain text into nicely formatted HTML. 



# How will we use this in class

We will use this notepad throughout the term to 
* Ask & answer questions as a class
* Share code, links and examples 
* Discuss & provide solutions to challenge questions 
* Create & curate lecture notes that will be added to our course webiste. 

To keep our work secure to this class, you need a Hack.md account. I suggest using your campus email. There is a navigation pane (only seen in view mode) on the right to help find content.


## How to toggle views

Click the buttons in the top right to switch between editing and viewing :eyes: (or both!)

* In editing mode, on the left pane you see the Markdown code for this document. 
* Different colors indicate different text formats. 
* Multiple users can add text simultaneously (Like google docs)


## Your turn
Introduce yourself. Name, pronouns, hometown, and one emoji.

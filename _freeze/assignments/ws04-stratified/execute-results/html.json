(Jasmine) \n\nWhat stratification variable(s) would you use for each of the following situations:\n\n(a) A political poll to estimate the percentage of registered voters in Arizona who approve of the governor's performance.\n(b) An e-mail survey of students at your university, to estimate the total amount of money students spend on textbooks in a term.\n(c) A sample of high schools in New York City to estimate the number of schools that offer one or more classes in computer programming.\n(d) A sample of public libraries in California to study the availability and usage of computer resources.\n(e) A survey of anglers visiting a freshwater lake, to learn about which species of fish are preferred.\n(f) An aerial survey to estimate the number of walrus in the pack ice near Alaska between 173∘ East and 154∘ West longitude.\n(g) A survey of businesses to learn about policies for paid leave.\n\n\n\n### 2.

Jasmine\n\nAn avid mystery reader selected a stratified random sample of 60 books from the list of 655 books that had been nominated through 2020 for an Edgar award from the Mystery Writers of America. Twelve strata were formed using the cross-classification of when the book was nominated (1946–1980, 1981–2000, 2001–2020), type of nomination (best novel or best first novel), and whether the book won the award (yes or no). Four books were selected randomly from each of the three strata with award winners, and six books were sampled randomly from each stratum with books that were nominated but did not win; this procedure oversampled the strata with winning books.\n\nThe file `mysteries.csv` contains selected information about each book, as well as the information on $N_{h}$ and $n_{h}$ used to calculate the sampling weights in variable p1weight. Give 95% CIs for your estimates in (b)–(d).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmyst <- read.csv(\"mysteries.csv\", header = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n* (a) Should you use an fpc when calculating variances? Why, or why not?\n* (b) What percentage of the books had at least one female author?\n* (c) What percentage of the books had at least one female detective?\n* (d) Estimate the total number of female detectives in the 655 books.\n\n\n### 13.

The advantages are that the variance within each strata is likely lower than the population variance. It is cost effected. The disadvantages are that the measurements may be inaccurate.\n\nb.\n\n\n\n",

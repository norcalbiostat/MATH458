We use this feature when drawing random numbers from named distributions using the `size` argument. \n[If you want to reproduce your exact numeric answer later, call `set.seed` immediately before any random draw. See the R companion for the text 2.1 for more info.]{.aside}\n\nThis code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12356)\nrnorm(10, 0,1) # draw 10 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] -0.4145277 -0.9731377  1.0433987 -0.3372572  1.2079743 -1.8673698\n [7]  1.0962468  2.3340728  1.0193901  1.1962093\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nis equivalent to  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12356)\nreplicate(10, { # repeat 10 times\n  rnorm(1, 0,1) # draw 1\n})\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] -0.4145277 -0.9731377  1.0433987 -0.3372572  1.2079743 -1.8673698\n [7]  1.0962468  2.3340728  1.0193901  1.1962093\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Without replacement\n\nThe selected unit is _not_ returned, and thus cannot be chosen a second time. This tends to be the preferred method, sampling the same unit multiple times does not provide more information. \n\nEvery possible subset of $n$ distinct units has the same probability of getting sampled. \n\n\n# Drawing an SRS\n\nRandom does not mean haphazard, contrary it's actually quite intentional. Avoid selecting a sample that you \"feel\" is random or representative of the population. These practices can lead to bias and lack of generalizability. \n\nInstead we use techniques that leverage pseudo-random number generating algorithms such as the `sample` function. \n  \n  \n:::{.callout-important}\n### How to draw a SRS \n1. Generate a list of all observational units in the population (sampling frame). \n2. Assign each observational unit a unique number, from 1 to the size of the sampling frame $N$. \n3. Use a computer to draw $n$ numbers from 1 to $N$ without replacement.   \n4. Subset the data to keep only the selected rows. \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\n### Example: Enrollment in Graduate Programs in Statistics\n\nThe [last time we saw this example](https://sampling-458.netlify.app/complete_notes/cn03-statistical_foundations_complete.html#variability-of-estimates), we used the `sample()` function to draw 10 values from the single variable `FTGradEnrollment`. Let's revisit this data and take an SRS of the entire dataset.  \n:::\n\nRead in the data and see how many record/rows there are. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstat.phd <- readr::read_csv(here::here(\"data\", \"StatisticsPhD.csv\")) \nNROW(stat.phd) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 82\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n[Get in the habit of opening the data set and visually looking at your process at each step.

The file `agpop.csv` (textbook data) contains historical information from 1982, 1987, and 1992 on the number of farms, total acreage devoted to farms, number of farms with fewer than 9 acres, and number of farms with more than 1000 acres for the population consisting of the $N=3078$ counties and county-equivalents in the United States. \n\nTake a random sample of $n=300$ from this data set, then generate a histogram of the variable `acres92`. Compare your results to your neighbor, and to Figure 2.4 in the text. _Set a seed for this example to ensure you get the same result each time you compile!_\n:::\n\n> Write a sentence here about how similar, or different your chart is from the class or the text. \n\n\n\n\n\n* Sampling Weights (Lohr Ch 2.4)\n\n# Estimating population parameters\n\n## mean\n* Expected value, variance, SE, CV, Bounds on error of estimation\n* FPC\n* Coefficient of variation\n\n## total: \n* Expected value, variance, SE, CV \n\n## Proportion\nExpected value, variance\n\n\n# Using the `survey` package. \n\n\n# Determining sample size \n\n# Model based theory vs Randomization based theory (Lohr 2.10, 2.11)\n\n# Closing: When should SRS be used\n* comparison to systemic sampling? \n\n\n# Analysis under SR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

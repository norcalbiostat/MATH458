Previously we saw how to use the `sample` function to accomplish this. An alternative is to use the functions `srswor` or `srswr` from the `sampling` package. We'll first look at how these functions differ. \n\n## Using `sample()`\n\n### With replacement\n\n* The same unit is \"put back\" into the pool of eligible units to sample from, and thus has a non-zero probability of being selected again. Notice with this method you can draw a larger sample than you have unique objects to draw from. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(c(\"cat\", \"dog\", \"fish\"), size=5, replace=TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"cat\"  \"dog\"  \"dog\"  \"fish\" \"dog\" \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n* Drawing a subset of $n$ units from the population can be thought of as drawing $n$ independent samples of size 1. We use this feature when drawing random numbers from named distributions using the `size` argument. \n[If you want to reproduce your exact numeric answer later, call `set.seed` immediately before any random draw. See the R companion for the text 2.1 for more info.]{.aside}\n\nThis code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12356)\nrnorm(10, 0,1) # draw 10 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] -0.4145277 -0.9731377  1.0433987 -0.3372572  1.2079743 -1.8673698\n [7]  1.0962468  2.3340728  1.0193901  1.1962093\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nis equivalent to  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12356)\nreplicate(10, { # repeat 10 times\n  rnorm(1, 0,1) # draw 1\n})\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] -0.4145277 -0.9731377  1.0433987 -0.3372572  1.2079743 -1.8673698\n [7]  1.0962468  2.3340728  1.0193901  1.1962093\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Without replacement\n\nThe selected unit is _not_ returned, and thus cannot be chosen a second time. This tends to be the preferred method, sampling the same unit multiple times does not provide more information. \n\nEvery possible subset of $n$ distinct units has the same probability of getting sampled.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(1:5, size=5, replace=FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5 2 1 3 4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Using the `sampling` package. \n\nWhen using `sample()` the vector of data that you want to sample from is provided as the first argument, and what is returned is the values in that vector. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanimals <- c(\"Riley\", \"Meka\", \"Toki\", \"TJ\", \"DC\", \"Dodger\")\nsample(animals, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"TJ\"   \"Meka\" \"Toki\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe functions `srswr` and `srswor` take two arguments: $n$ the sample size, and $N$ the population size, and what is returned is a vector of length $N$ that indicates how many times that position in the vector is selected.  \n\n### With replacement\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(4134)\n(choose.these.wr <- srswr(3,6))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0 2 0 1 0 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Without replacement\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(choose.these.wor <- srswor(3,6))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1 0 0 1 0 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThen the `getdata()` function is used to extract the values from the population the indicated number of times. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetdata(animals, choose.these.wr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Meka\" \"Meka\" \"TJ\"  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetdata(animals, choose.these.wor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  ID_unit   data\n1       1  Riley\n2       4     TJ\n3       6 Dodger\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis method can be advantageous when drawing with replacement from a large dataset. \n\n# Intentionality\n\nRandom does not mean haphazard, contrary it's actually quite intentional. Avoid selecting a sample that you \"feel\" is random or representative of the population. These practices can lead to bias and lack of generalizability. \n\n:::{.callout-note appearance=minimal}\n### :question: :busts_in_silhouette: Turn and talk\nSuppose you want to estimate the number of weed clusters of a certain type in a field. \n\n* What is the population and what would you use for sampling units? \n* How would you select a simple random sample? \n* If a sampling unit is an area such as a square yard, does the size chosen for a sampling unit affect the accuracy of results? \n* What considerations go into our choice of sampling unit? \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\" appearance=minimal}\n* Population: All plots of that type of field\n* Sampling unit: The plots of land\n* Yes. Larger plots of land will have more weed clusters\n* Feasibility, size of land, terrain type\n:::\n\n\nTo avoid the haphazard nature of \"blindly choosing\", or worse looking at what was sampled and changing it because \"it doesn't look random enough\", we use techniques that leverage pseudo-random number generating algorithms such as the functions discussed above. \n  \n:::{.callout-important}\n**How to draw a SRS**\n1. Generate a list of all observational units in the population (sampling frame). \n2. Assign each observational unit a unique number, from 1 to the size of the sampling frame $N$. \n3. Use a computer to draw $n$ numbers from 1 to $N$ without replacement.   \n4. Subset the data to keep only the selected rows. \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\n### Example: Enrollment in Graduate Programs in Statistics\n\nThe [last time we saw this example](https://sampling-458.netlify.app/complete_notes/cn03-statistical_foundations_complete.html#variability-of-estimates), we used the `sample()` function to draw 10 values from the single variable `FTGradEnrollment`.

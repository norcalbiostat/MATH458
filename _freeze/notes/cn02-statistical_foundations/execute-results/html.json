Because the bias and the variance of estimators determine their goodness, we need to review the basic ideas concerned with the expectation and variance of a random variable. This set of notes follows Lohr 2.2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n*Reminder: Most people come into this class with different pre-requisite classes and instructors. This recap helps ensure that we are all on the same page with concepts and notation that may be new for some.*\n\nThese notes require the `StatisticsPhD.csv` data file. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstat.phd <- readr::read_csv(here::here(\"data\", \"StatisticsPhD.csv\"))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nStatistical inference centers around using information from a sample to understand what might be true about the entire population of interest. If all we see are the data in the sample, what conclusions can we draw about the population? How sure are we about the accuracy of those conclusions?\n\nOn April 29, 2011, Prince William married Kate Middleton in London. The Pew Research Center reports that 34% of US adults watched some or all of the royal wedding. How do we know that 34% of all US adults watched? Did anyone ask **you** if you watched it? In order to know for sure what proportion of US adults watched the wedding, we would need to ask **all** US adults whether or not they watched. This would be very difficult to do. As we will see, however, we can estimate the *population* proportion *parameter* quite accurately with a *sample statistic*, as long as we use a random sample. In the case of the royal wedding, the estimate is based on a poll using a random sample of 1006 US adults.\n\n-   *Statistical inference*: \n-   *Parameter*: \n-   *Statistic*: \n\nGenerally our goal is to know the value of the population parameter exactly but this usually isn't possible since we usually cannot collect information from the entire population.\n\nInstead we can select a sample from the population, calculate the quantity of interest for the sample, and use this sample statistic to estimate the value for the whole population.\n\n::: callout-warning\n### ⭐ You try it\n\nThe US Census states that 27.5% of US adults who are at least 25 years old have a college bachelor's degree or higher. Suppose that in a random sample of $n$=200 US residents who are 25 or older, 58 of them have a college bachelor's degree or higher.\n\nWhat is the population parameter? What is the sample statistic? Use correct notation for your answer.\n:::\n\n> write your solution here\n\nThe value of a statistic for a particular sample gives a *point estimate* of the population parameter. If we only have the one sample and don't know the value of the population parameter, this point estimate is our best estimate of the true value of the population parameter.\n\nAfter we have a little more mathematical terminology and foundation, we'll come back to what we mean by \"best estimate\", and examine how we can determine if something is a \"good\" estimate.\n\n\n# Expected Values\n\nGenerally we want to understand some measured characteristic $y$ about the units in the population.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"true\"}\n### Example: University parking garages\n\nConsider the population of 4 universities $U$ in the North State (Humboldt, Chico, Sac, Davis), and we are interested in knowing the total number of campus owned parking garages at these campuses.\n\n$$ \nU = \\{A, B, C, D\\}\n$$\n:::\n\nThe population total $\\tau$ would then be calculated as\n\n$$\n\\tau = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}\n$$ where the $\\sum$ symbols means to sum over all the values of $y_{i}$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, N$ units in the population.\n\nHowever the nature of sampling means that $y_{i}$ is not observed for every unit in the population. In this case, we are going to consider a sample $S$ of 2 campuses. There are six different ways 2 units could be chosen from $U$. $$\nS_{1} = \\{A,B\\}, S_{2} = \\{A,C\\}, S_{3} = \\{A,D\\}, \\\\\nS_{5} = \\{?, ?\\}, S_{5} = \\{?, ?\\}, S_{6} = \\{?, ?\\}\n$$\n\nThen we estimate the population value $\\tau$ using an estimate $\\hat{t}$, where we sum over all the values of $y_{i}$ when that $i^{th}$ campus is present in the chosen sample.\n\n$$\n\\hat{t} = \\sum_{i \\in S}y_{i}\n$$\n\nLet's assume we know the number of parking garages at each campus $y_{A} = 2, y_{B} = 4, y_{C} = 1, y_{D} = 3$. We can build a **sampling distribution**, that is a distribution of all possible values for $\\hat{t}$ based on this design. \n\nThe total from sample 1 $\\hat{t}_{1} = y_{A} + y_{B} = 6$ is the total calculated from campus A and B, sample 2 total is $\\hat{t}_{2} = y_{A} + y_{C} = 3$, and so forth. Doing this for all 6 samples results in the following graph:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cn02-statistical_foundations_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|------------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n| k | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n| $P(\\hat{t} = k)$ | $\\frac{?}{?}$ | $\\frac{?}{?}$ | $\\frac{?}{?}$ | $\\frac{?}{?}$ | $\\frac{?}{?}$ |\n\n: Sampling distribution for the estimated sample total $\\hat{t}$ number of parking garages on two randomly selected college campuses in the north state.\n\nThe only reason we can calculate these probabilities exactly is because we knew the full population and were able to enumerate all possible combinations of samples. In practice we use statistical theory such as the Central Limit theorem to describe the characteristics of sampling distributions so that we can use them to estimate quantities such as means and variances.\n\n::: callout-important\n### Definition: Expected Value\n\nThe expected value of the statistic is....\n$$\nE[y]=\\sum_{y}y*p(y)\n$$\n\nwhere $p(y)$ is the probability of each value of $y$ occurring.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n### Example calculation of $E(y)$ from a discrete probability distribution\n\n| y   | p(y) |\n|-----|------|\n| 1   | .1   |\n| 2   | .5   |\n| 3   | .4   |\n\n$E[y]=\\sum_{y}yp(y) = (1)(.1) + (2)(.5) + (3)(.4) = 2.3$\n:::\n\nWe can use R to calculate this for us.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <-       # Define a vector y of data values\np.y <-  # define a vector of probabilities\n(E.y <- )  # multiply the elements of y and p.y, then sum\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in parse(text = input): <text>:3:9: unexpected ')'\n2: p.y <-  # define a vector of probabilities\n3: (E.y <- )\n           ^\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\n### Definition: Population Mean\n\nThe population mean $\\mu$ is defined as ....\n\n$$E[y]=\\mu$$\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\n### Definition: Population Variance & Standard Deviation\n\n$$\\sigma^{2} = V(y)=E[y-\\mu]^{2}=\\sum_{y}\\left(y-\\mu\\right)^{2}*p(y)$$\n\nThe variability of measurements in a population can be measured by the **variance** which is defined as ...\n\nThe standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance, and is denoted $\\sigma$.\n\nOften it's more convenient to calculate the variance using this formulation:\n\n$$\n\n\n$$\n:::\n\nUsing R on the probability distribution defined above this would look like;\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny.sq <-             # square y\nE.y.sq <-   # calculate E(y^2)\n(Var.y <- )  # Calculate the variance of y\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in parse(text = input): <text>:3:11: unexpected ')'\n2: E.y.sq <-   # calculate E(y^2)\n3: (Var.y <- )\n             ^\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n### ⭐ You try it\n\nWhen a few data points are repeated in a data set, the results are often arrayed in a frequency table.

In such situations, each sampled element has the same chance of being selected and the selections are independent of one another.\n\n-   Most sampling problems don't live in an infinite world, but the population is usually finite although it may be quite large.\n-   In addition, we may want to take into consideration varying the probabilities with which the units are sampled.\n\nIn *probability sampling*, each possible sample $S$ has a known probability $\\delta$ of being chosen. Let's return to the university parking garage example and use $P(\\delta_{1} = ?), P(\\delta_{2} = ?), P(\\delta_{6} = ?)$ and the rest have probability 0.\n\nAdditionally, each unit $i$ within the universe $U$ has a $\\pi_{i} \\gt 0$ probability of appearing in the selected sample. These unit probabilities are a function of the probability of selecting that random sample.\n\n|  |  |  |\n|:----------------:|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------:|\n| $\\pi_{A}$ = | $P(\\delta_{1}) + ...$ |  |\n| $\\pi_{B}$ = | $P(\\delta_{1}) + ...$ |  |\n| $\\pi_{C}$ = | $P(\\delta_{2}) + ...$ |  |\n| $\\pi_{D}$ = | $P(\\delta_{3}) + ...$ |  |\n\nSo in this case, not all units (campuses) $i$ have the same probability of appearing in our sample.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n### ⭐ You try it\n\nChange the values of $\\delta$ for each of the 6 possible samples of $U$ above, so that each sample has a non-zero probabilty of being chosen.

Many of these firms will be small and a few firms will be large. In a random sample *of firms*, the size of the firm is not taken into account. However, the number of job openings will be directly dependent on the size of the firm. Thus, we might improve the sample if large firms are more likely to be included in the sample.\n:::\n\n-   Suppose the population consists of the set of elements $\\{u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{N}\\}$ and a sample of $n$ elements is to be selected with replacement independently of one another.\n-   Let $\\{\\delta_{1},\\delta_{2},...,\\delta_{N}\\}$ represent the respective probabilities of selection for the population elements.\n    -   $\\delta_{i}$ is the probability that $u_{i}$ is selected on any one draw.\n    -   for the case of random sampling with replacement, each $\\delta_{i} = ?$\n\nAn **unbiased estimator** of the population total, $\\tau$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{y_{i}}{\\delta_{i}}\n$$\n\nWhen $\\delta_{i} = ?$, we can rewrite this as\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{y_{i}}{(1/N)} = \\frac{N}{n} \\sum^{n}_{i=1}y_{i} = N\\bar{y}\n$$\n\nIt is in the best interest to select the $\\delta_{i}$ values in such a way that the variance is as small as possible.

It also states that the shape of the distribution should be approximately Normal for a large $n$.\n\n# Properties of Estimators\n\nIn general, suppose that $\\hat{\\theta}$ is an estimator of the parameter $\\theta$. Two properties that we would like $\\hat{\\theta}$ to have are\n\n1.  The estimate is **unbiased**: \n2.  The estimate is **precise**: \n\nTo clarify:\n\n-   **Measurement bias** means that the $y$'s are ......\n    -   That means an estimator of a total $\\tau$ calculated as $\\hat{t} = \\sum_{i \\in U} y_{i}$ where $U$ is the entire universe, then $\\hat{t}$ itself would not be the true total of interest.\n    -   Trying to estimate heights of students, but your ruler is always off 3 cm\n-   **Estimation bias** means that the estimator chosen resulted in ________.\n    -   If we calculated the total as $t' = \\sum_{i \\in L} y_{i}$ from a random sample of $L$ units in the universe, $\\hat{t'}$ would be biased.\n    -   Trying to estimate heights of students by taking a sample of the shorter students only.\n\nIf two unbiased estimators are available for $\\theta$ we generally prefer the one with ____________.\n\nBecause sometimes we use biased estimators, we often use the **__________________** instead of the variance to estimate the **__________________**.\n\n::: callout-important\n### Definition: Bias, Variance, Accuracy\n\n$$\\mbox{Bias}(\\hat{\\theta}) = $$\n\n$$V(\\hat{\\theta})  = $$\n\n$$\\mbox{MSE}(\\hat{\\theta}) = $$\n:::\n\n\n-   A is **______________**.

Why?\n\n## Standard Error\n\n::: callout-important\n### Definition: Standard Error\n\nThe *standard error* of a statistic is ......\n:::\n\nThe standard error of a statistic tells us how much the sample statistic will vary from sample to sample. In situations like above where we can examine the distribution of the sample statistic using simulation, we can estimate the standard error by taking the sample standard deviation of the sampling distribution. In other situations we can use closed form mathematical formulas to calculate the standard error.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"true\"}\n### Example Grad program example cont.\n\nEstimate the standard error for the mean enrollment in statistics PhD programs for a sample size of 10 and also a sample size of 20.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(many.means) #because the example above already had n=10\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: object 'many.means' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreplicate(n=100, {\n  my.sample.programs <- sample(stat.phd$FTGradEnrollment, size=20)\n  mean(my.sample.programs)\n}) |> sd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 6.008961\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Confidence Intervals\n\nWhen the distributions are relatively symmetric and bell-shaped, the 95% rule tells us that approximately 95% of the data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Applying the 95% rule to sampling distributions, we see that about 95% of the sample statistics will fall within two standard errors of the mean. We use this rule many times to form what we call an approximate 95% confidence interval which gives us a range for which which we are quite confident that captures the true parameter we are trying to estimate.\n\nWhen using a formula to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval, use ______________ as the margin of error.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"true\"}\n### CI for PhD program enrollment\n\nBased on our example, what would be a 95% confidence interval for $\\mu$ the true mean total enrollment for PhD programs in statistics.

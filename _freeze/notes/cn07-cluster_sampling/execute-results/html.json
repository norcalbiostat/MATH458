Taking a cluster sample of a few nursing homes and then taking observations from everyone in them would be less expensive and time consuming.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=false}\nA cluster is similar to a stratum because it is grouping members of the population.\n\nHowever, cluster sampling reduces precision compared to SRS whereas precision is increased with a stratified sample. \n:::\n\nThis is because members of the same cluster tend to be very similar, and sampling everyone in the cluster results in the same information being repeated rather than learning new information.\n\nMost large surveys usually use cluster sampling, most likely because of the low costs and convenience compared to other sampling methods\n\nTo increase the precision of the clusters, survey conductors could group the population primary sampling units (the clusters) into stratas and select a probability sample of psus within each stratum. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# One-Stage Clustering Sampling\n\n## Equal size clusters\n\n-   Each *psu* has the same number of elements; $M_{i} = m_{i} = M$.\n-   Often can be found in agriculture or industrial sampling.\n-   $t_{i}$ is the total for all elements in *psu* $i$.\n-   $t_{i}$ is known for sampled households, since data is collected on both individuals. (E.g. $Var(t_{i})=0$)\n\n:arrow_right: Treat the *psu* means or totals as observations, and ignore the individual elements. We now have an SRS of $n$ data points.\n\nThus we can use the same SRS formulas to estimate the total and mean, **however** this is an SRS of $n$ *psu*'s, not an SRS of $nM$ observational units. So the $df$ needed to create a Confidence Interval is $n-1$.\n\nTo estimate the population total $t$ or average $\\mu$, we can use the following estimators and variances:\n\n$$\n\\hat{t} = \\frac{N}{n}\\sum_{i \\in S}t_{i} \\qquad \ns_{t}^{2} = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i \\in S}\\Big(t_{i} - \\frac{\\hat{t}}{N}\\Big)^2\n$$\n\nand $$\n\\hat{\\bar{y}} = \\frac{\\hat{t}}{NM} \\qquad\nV(\\hat{\\bar{y}}) = \\Big(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\Big)\\frac{s^{2}_t}{nM^2}\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"true\"}\n### Estimate the income in a two person households\n\nConsider individual incomes ($y_{ij}$) for each of $j=1,2$ persons in the 3 sampled households out of the 50 in the population.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhhi <- data.frame(\n  household = c(1:3), \n  yi1 = c(37638, 69012, 30001), \n  yi2 = c(79999, 86753, 54321)\n)\nkable(hhi, align = 'c')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| household |  yi1  |  yi2  |\n|:---------:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|     1     | 37638 | 79999 |\n|     2     | 69012 | 86753 |\n|     3     | 30001 | 54321 |\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nFirst define our known values: N = 50, n = 3, M = 2.\n\nThe total household income $t_i$ is calculated as the sum of the individual incomes within each cluster $\\sum_j y_{ij}$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhhi$ti <- hhi$yi1 + hhi$yi2\nhhi\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  household   yi1   yi2     ti\n1         1 37638 79999 117637\n2         2 69012 86753 155765\n3         3 30001 54321  84322\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe estimated mean is\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.hat <- (50/3)*sum(hhi$ti)\n(ybar.hat <- t.hat / (50*2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 59620.67\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nwith variance\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns2.t <- (1/(3-1))*sum((hhi$ti - t.hat/50)^2)\n(var.ybar.hat <- (1 - 3/50)*(s2.t/(3*2^2)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 100106551\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCalculate CI.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrit.t <- qt(.975, 3-1)\nci.low.mu  <- ybar.hat - crit.t*sqrt(var.ybar.hat)\nci.hi.mu   <- ybar.hat + crit.t*sqrt(var.ybar.hat)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can be 95% confident that the average population income for a household of two people is contained in the interval ($16,571, $102,670.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n### :star: You try it: Average GPA in a dorm\n\nA student wants to estimate the average GPA in their dorm.

From that we'll draw a sample of $n=4$ programs out of these 10. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstats <- readr::read_csv(here::here(\"data\", \"StatisticsPhD.csv\"))\n(stats10 <- )\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Using the `sample()` function\n\n**without replacement**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npop.idx <-   # Steps 1, 2\n(idx <- ) # Step 3 \nstats10[idx,]               # Step 4\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n* Rows ...... were chosen. \n\n**with replacement**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(4134) # set seed for demonstration of duplicate records\n(idx.with.dups <- #3 \nstats10[idx.with.dups,] #4\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n* Rows ..... were chosen. \n* Carnegie (row 4) was sampled twice. \n\n## Using the `sampling` package\n\n* The functions `srswr(n,N)` and `srswor(n,N)` draw SRS with, and without replacement respectively. \n* Each take two arguments: $n$ the sample size, and $N$ the population size. \n    - The vector returned is a vector of length $N$ that indicates how many times that position in the vector is selected.  \n    Then the `getdata()` function is used to extract the values from the population the indicated number of times.\n\n**without replacement**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(choose.these.wor <- ) # Steps 1,2,3\ngetdata(stats10, )     # Steps 4\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**with replacement**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(4134)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n* Again, notice Columbia was chosen twice when sampling with replacement. \n* Interestingly, the result from sampling without replacement added a column called `ID_unit` on it that denotes the row it was sampled from. \n\n:::{.callout-warning icon=false}\n### You try it \n\nThe U.S. government conducts a Census of Agriculture every five years, collecting data on all farms (defined as any place from which \\$1000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold). The file `agpop.csv` (textbook data) contains historical information from 1982, 1987, and 1992 on the number of farms, total acreage devoted to farms, number of farms with fewer than 9 acres, and number of farms with more than 1000 acres for the population consisting of the $N=3078$ counties and county-equivalents in the United States.\n\nDraw a sample of 300 farms without replacement using both `sample` and `srswor`. Save one of these data frames with the name `ag.srs` for later use. \n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Formulas for Estimation\n\nBelow is a table of common statistics and how they are estimated under the SRS framework.

Every once in a while its a good idea to clean out your global environment to not get confused. Use the `rm()` function to remove everything except the population `ag`, our sample of 300 `ag.srs`, and their respective sample sizes: `n` and `N`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nls()[!ls() %in% c()]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n# Sampling Weights (Lohr Ch 2.4)\n\nRecall that a goal of sampling is to obtain a representative sample, one that is similar to the true unknown population. Thus, conceptually if we duplicate certain units from our sample a certain amount of times, we could \"reconstruct\" what the population looks like. That is, we could create ....... copies of unit ....... for each unit in the sample. \n\n::: callout-important\n### Definition: Sampling Weight (Design weight)\n\n\n:::\n\nIn an SRS, each unit has an inclusion probability of $\\delta_{i} = \\frac{?}{?}$, so the sampling weights are all $w_{i} =\\frac{?}{?}$. \n\nWe don't _actually_ make $w_{i}$ copies of record $i$, but use these weights as a multiplier in our estimation calculations. \n\n|         Population size         |                   Total                    |                   Mean                    |\n|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------------:|\n| $\\hat{N} = \\sum_{i \\in S}w_{i}$ | $\\hat{\\tau} = \\sum_{i \\in S}w_{i}y_{i}$ | $\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{N}}$ |\n\nThese weighted estimators are used in all probability sampling designs. \n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\n### Example: Calculating weighted estimates\nEstimate the total and average number of acres devoted to farms in 1992 using both weighted and unweighted estimates. Then compare these values to the parameter. \n:::\n\nThe sampling weights are $w_{i} = \\frac{?}{?}$ for each unit $i$ in the sample, so we'll add that on as a new column before calculating the weighted estimates. \n[See Lohr Table 2.1 for a nicer visual of the data frame with weights. ]{.aside}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nCalculate weighted and unweighted estimates, then the pop parameters. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntau.hat.wt <- \ny.bar.wt   <- \ntau.hat.nowt <- \ny.bar.nowt   <- \nmu  <- \ntau <- \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nPackage it in a data frame for easier viewing. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.frame(\n  Measure = c(\"Total\", \"Mean\"), \n  Parameter = c(tau,mu),\n  Unweighted = c(tau.hat.nowt, y.bar.nowt), \n  Weighted = c(tau.hat.wt, y.bar.wt)\n  ) |> knitr::kable(align = 'lccc', \n             caption = \"Comparing weighted and unweighted estimates\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that when we have an SRS with equal sampling weights $w_{i} = \\frac{N}{n}$, the weighted mean is equal to the weighted mean. \n\n:::{.callout-warning icon=false}\n### You try it\nCalculate the proportion of farms with less than 200k acres, with, and without weights. Compare to the population proportion. \n:::\n\n# Analysis using the `survey` package (Lohr Ch 2.6)\n\nSurvey designs are specified using the `________` function. The main arguments to the the function are id to specify sampling units, weights to specify sampling weights, and fpc to specify finite population size corrections. These arguments should be given as formulas, referring to columns in a data frame given as the data argument.\n[Similar to using `group_by` in dplyr, that adds a \"flag\" to the data set indicting that all subsequent actions are to be done to each group separately, the `svydesign` function adds information to the data set so subsequent actions know how to incorporate measures like weights and strata]{.aside}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `id` argument specifies the clusters. We are not using any clustering, so each unit has it's own id. \n\n## Point and interval estimates\n\nSurvey design adjusted estimates can be obtained using `svymean` and `svytotal`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nEstimates for multiple variables can be obtained at the same time. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can pass the results to construct confidence intervals. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n> interpretation here \n\n:::{.callout-warning icon=false}\n### You try it\nUsing your sample of 300 farms, estimate the total number of farms in the United States in 1987 and the average farm size in acres for the same year.

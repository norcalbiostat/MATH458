So some fancy mathematician by the name of Laplace decided he was going to figure it out using sampling and some ideas behind measure of association. \n\nHe sampled 30 communities throughout the country, totaling 2,037,615 people. \n\nHe reasoned that communities with large populations are also likely to have a large number of registered births. So he looked back in the prior 3 years and counted the number of live births in those communities, finding it to be 215,599. Dividing that number by 3, he calculated this was about 71,866.33 births per year. \n\nHe then divided the total number of people, by the number of births pear year, $\\frac{2037615}{71866.33} = 28.352845$, as an estimate of the number of people alive for each new birth. \n\nAssuming this ratio is similar throughout France, he concluded that the total population of France could be estimated by multiplying the total number of annual births in the country by that ratio $28.352845$. \n\nLaplace was not interested in the number of births on it's own, but used it as _auxilary information_ to estimate the desired quantity of total population.\n:::\n\n## Using Auxilary information\n\nSometimes due to difficulty or cost of data collection, researchers may collect data on secondary measures that are known to be associated with the measure of interest, then leverage that association to improve the precision of the estimators. \n\nTwo methods to do this are called **Ratio** and **Regression** estimation. \n\n# Ratio Estimation in SRS\n\nLet $y_{i}$ be the measure of interest, and $x_{i}$ be the auxiliary/secondary/subsidiary variable. Both measurements **MUST** be taken on the same sample unit $i$. \n\nThen in a population of size $N$ the totals for each measure are\n\n$$\nt_{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^Ny_{i} \\qquad t_{x} = \\sum_{i=1}^Nx_{i}\n$$\n\nand their ratio is calculated as\n$$\nB = \\frac{t_{y}}{t_{x}} = \\frac{\\mu_{y}}{\\mu_{x}}.\n$$\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\n### Example: Farm yield\n\nSuppose the population consists of agricultural fields of different sizes. Let\n\n* $y_{i}$ = bushels of grain harvested in field $i$\n* $x_{i}$ = acreage of field $i$. \n:::\n\nThen \n\n* $B$ = average yield in bushels per acre\n* $\\mu_{y}$ = average yield in bushels per field\n* $t_{y}$ = total yield in bushels\n\nIf we take an SRS, we can then calculate the ratio estimates for these values using\n\n* $\\hat{B} = \\frac{\\bar{y}}{\\bar{x}} =  \\frac{\\hat{t}_y}{\\hat{t}_x}$\n* $\\hat{\\bar{y}_r} = \\hat{B}\\mu_x$\n* $\\hat{t}_{yr} = \\hat{B}t_x$\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n### :question: Why $B$?\n\nThe equation $y = Bx$ is a linear equation line, with $B$ as the slope!\n:::\n\n# Why use Ratio Estimation\n\n#### 1. It's our metric of interest\n\nWhen we sample populations, sometimes we are interested in ratios. \n\n**Such as:**\nThe average crop yield per acre (Dr.D example)\nThe ratio of liabilities to assets\nFish caught per hour\nPer Capita household income\n\nHowever, when should/can you use ratio estimation?  General rule of thumb, if the denominator of your ratio of interest is something that would be likely to change from sample to sample, ratio estimation is a valid course of action.\n\n**Example**\nLet’s say you wanted to find the percent of pages in your favorite magazine that contain at least one advertisement.\n\nTo do so, you sample ten different magazine issues.  You count the total number of pages in each ith magazine, $x_i$, and the number of pages that contain at least one advertisement in each ith magazine, $y_i$.\n\nThe proportion of interest, $\\hat{B}$, would be the overall total number of pages with ads, $\\hat{t}_y$, divided by the overall total amount of pages, $\\hat{t}_x$.\n\nOr $\\hat{B} = \\frac{\\hat{t}_y}{\\hat{t}_x}$\n\nIt is important to note that the denominator is not the number of issues you randomly sampled, as that would always be ten, or whatever number of issues you chose to sample.  The denominator,  in this case, was the sum of pages of the issues you would sample.  We want our denominator to be something that could vary, as we would expect it to vary in accordance to whatever the true ratio is.\n\n**Common Usages:**\n\nRatio estimation is used every time an SRS is taken to estimate a mean or proportion for a subpopulation \n\nIn cluster sampling, ratio estimation is commonly used to estimate means.\n\n#### 2. Unknown N\n\nSometimes we want to estimate a population total, but the population size N is unknown.\n\nFor instance, we want estimate the total number of fish in a haul that are longer than 12 cm.\n\n* First we would take a random sample of fish\n    * Initially, we would estimate the proportion of fish that are larger than 12 cm, and  multiply that proportion by the total number of fish, N. Or, $\\hat{t_y} = N * \\bar{y}$\n    * However, we cannot do this because we don't know N\n* Find auxiliary information\n    * We can the fact  that having a length of more than 12 cm (y) is related to weight (x).\n    * Used the proportion of total weight of haul by average weight if the fish. The book explains that its easy to find the total weight of the haul, and the average weight of a fish; AUTHORITY.\n* We need to manipulate the following equation:\n    * $\\frac{\\hat{t_y}}{\\hat{t_x}} = \\frac{\\bar{y}}{\\bar{x}}$\n    * $\\hat{t_y} = \\frac{\\bar{y}*{\\hat{t_x}}}{\\bar{x}}$\n    * $\\hat{t_y} = \\bar{y} * \\frac{\\hat{t_x}}{\\bar{x}}$\n\n\n$\\hat{t_y}$: our estimated total number of fish in a haul\n\n$\\bar{y}$: average length of the fish longer than 12 cm\n\n$\\hat{t_x}$: total weight of the haul\n\n$\\bar{x}$: average weight of a fish\n\nOverall, we find an auxiliary information that we can use to relate to another known value. We manipulate the following equation: $\\hat{B} = \\frac{\\hat{t_y}}{\\hat{t_x}} = \\frac{\\bar{y}}{\\bar{x}}$, then add in the known values to find our unknown value.\n\n\n\n#### 3. Strong correlation \n\nThe higher the correlation coefficient, the better ratio estimation works.\n\nFrance had no population census in 1802 and Laplace wanted to estimate the number of people living there. Laplace observed the number of births over the next 3 years and came up with the ratio of for every 1 birth there is 28.352845 persons. The number 28 was reached by dividing the total population in the 30 communes by dividing the amount of births over the 3 years by 3. His reasoning was that communes with large, and it would be similar throughout France. \n\nRatio estimation is often used to increase the precision of estimated means and totals.\n$y_{i}$= numbers of persons in commune i\n$x_{i}$= number of registered births in commune i \n\nLaplace reasoned the ratio estimator would obtain better precision than multiplying the average number of persons by the 30 communes. \nThe larger the population of a commune, the higher the number of registered births, thus the correlation coefficient is likely to be positive. \n\nIf the $t_{x}$= total number of registered births is known, the mean squared error of the estimated total of the $\\hat{t_y}$ = $\\hat{B_tx}$ is likely to be smaller than the MSE of the population mean and estimator that does not use additional information of registered birth.\n\n\n#### 4. Adjust for demographic totals\n\nRatio estimation is used to adjust estimates from the sample to reflect demographic totals. \n\n* Say an SRS was taken of 400 out of 4000 students at a university, and there were 240 women and 160 men in the sample\n    * Say 84 women and 40 men wanted to be teachers\n    * Using info from the SRS you’d conclude (4000/400)*(84+40) =1240 students want to be teachers at this university\n    * If we know there are 2700 women and 1300 men at this university, then we’d conclude (84/240)*2700 + (40/160)*1300=1270 students want to be teachers\n* In this example we used ratio estimation within each gender, so we adjust our estimate for the total according to the ratio within the population\n* For this instance, we are adjusting our estimate for the total amount of women who want to be teachers because 60% of the sample is women but the population of women is 67.5%\n    * $y_{i}$ = 1 if woman and plans career in teaching, 0 otherwise\n    *    $x_{i}$ = 1 if woman, 0 otherwise\n * (84/240)*2700 = 945 is the ratio estimate for the total amount of women who want to teach \n* (40/160)*1300 = 325 is the ratio estimate for the total amount of men who want to teach\n* This use of ratio estimation is also called poststratification \n\n\n\n\n#### 5. Ratio Estimation may be used to adjust for non-response.  \n\n* Suppose a sample of businesses is taken  \n* Let $y_i$ be the amount spent on health insurance by business $i$ , and let let $x_i$ be the number of employees in business $i$ .  \n* Assume that $t_x$ the total number of employees in all businesses in the population is known.  \nWe expect that the amount that the business spends on healthcare will be related to the number of employees that the business has. Because some businesses may not respond to the survey, one way to adjust for non-response is:  \n* Multiply the data $\\bar{y}$ / $\\bar{x}$ using the data from only the respondents by the population total $t_x$.   \n\nIf companies with fewer employees are less likely to respond, and $y_i$ is proportional to $x_i$, then we would expect the estimate $N\\bar{y}$ to overestimate the population total $t_y$\n\nBut, in the ratio estimation, the estimate is likely to be smaller than N because companies with many employees are more likely to respond. \n\nTherefore, the ratio estimate will help compensate for the non-response of small companies. \n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\n### Example: Total acreage of farms in 1992, based on data from '87. \n\n[Pretend it's 1992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDKO6XYXioc) and since we did a census of farmland in 1987 we the true population values. But that was super expensive so we want to find a better way for this year. \n \nIn 1987 a total of $t_x$ = 964,470,625 acres were devoted to farms across the 3,078 counties in the US, with average acres per county $\\mu_x$ = 313,343.3.

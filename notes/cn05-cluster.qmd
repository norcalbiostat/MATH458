# One-Stage Clustering Sampling

## Equal size clusters: Estimation

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
### Example: Average GPA in a dorm

:::

```{r}
gpa <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "gpa.csv"))
```

### Sampling Weights

## Equal size clusters: Theory

### Comparing a cluster sample with an SRS of the same size

### ANalysis Of VAriance
Don't recall how ANOVA works to break up the variance into components? See [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36DMVJ4Ibo&list=PLkIselvEzpM5G3IO1tzQ-DUThsJKQzQCD) from the Open Intro Statistics author, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel

### Ratio Estimation


### Estimation using weights



:::{.callout-tip icon=false}
### Example. High school Algebra
Consider a population of 187 high school algebra classes in a city. An investigator takes an SRS of classes, and gives each student in the sampled classes a test about function knowledge. The (hypothetical) data are given in the file `algebra.csv`. 

a. Load in the data and look at the first few rows. Explain what the values in each column mean.
b. Plot the distribution of test score by class. Interpret your graph by comparing the medians, ranges, and variances across classes. What do you notice?
c. How many _psus_ are there? What is the _psu_ with the highest number of _ssus_? Which one has the least? You must answer this question using R functions such as`unique` or `table`. Don't count this by hand (practice for when you have a billion rows)
d. Add variables containing the weights and the `fpc` to this data set. 
e. Using the proper functions from the `survey` package, estimate the population average algebra score, with a 95% interval and interpret your interval. Be sure to NOT assume a Z-distribution for this confidence interval but use the `degf` function to get the proper degrees of freedom out of the survey design object and pass it to the `confint` function.

# Two-Stage Clustering Sampling

![Textbook Figure 5.2. Differences between one-stage and two-stage cluster sampling.](../figs/fig5_2.jpg)

## Unbiased estimator of population total.

## Survey weights

## Variance estimation for two-stage cluster samples.

### Simplified version



:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
### Example 5.7: More estimation of math scores. 

The file `schools.csv` contains data from a two-stage sample of students from hypothetical classes. The final weights are provided in the variable `finalwt`. 

a) Create side by side boxplots for the math score for sampled schools. Which do you think is larger, the within or between cluster variance? 
b) Create an ANOVA table for this example. Is your interpretation from the graph upheld by this analysis? 
c) Estimate with proper 95% CI the average math score for the population of students under consideration. _Do not include a value for the `fpc` in this example_.

# What is Stratified Sampling (Lohr 3.1)

::: callout-important
#### Key Terms

**Stratified sampling** is the method by which a population is broken into $H$ subgroups(strata). Independent SRS's are taken on each subgroup. Our samples are then polled to generate overall population estimates.

**Strata** are subgroups of a population that do not intersect and add up to the whole population.
:::

## Why Use A Stratified Sample?

1.  **You can protect against the possibility of a really bad sample with overrepresentation of a subpopulation.** Stratified Sampling guarantees set proportions of subpopulations in your sample. Example: You can ensure 50% male and 50% female in a sample.
2.  **Stratified sampling means you can know the precision of the data collected for subgroups of the population.** Example: comparing experiences of male and female graduates when males vastly outnumber female graduates.
3.  **Stratified sampling can be less costly or more convenient.** You can use different sampling frames, designs, or field procedures for different strata. Example: You could use mail, email, telephone, or internet surveys based on what works best for each subpopulation
4.  **This method has lower variance estimates for population means and totals making it more precise than an SRS.** This is demonstrated using a motivating example next.

## Example: Using the four census regions of the United States

The data contained in `agstrat.csv` comes from a is stratified sample across four regions of the United States: Northeast, North Central, South, and West.

Using this stratified sample, estimate the total number of acres of farmland in the United States in 1992 by calculating the within strata totals, and then combining across strata. 
:::

Since we took an SRS in each stratum, we estimate the population total within each stratum using 

$\hat{t} = N\bar{y}$ and $\hat{V}(\hat{\tau}) = N^{2}\hat{V}(\bar{y})$ within each strata.

For example to estimate the total number of acres devoted to farms in the Northeast, 


```{r}
220*97629.81
```

with estimated variance
```{r}
220^2*(1-21/220)*(7647472708)/21
```

```
2. Calculate Population region sizes, add this vector to the data frame created above.
3. Calculate the within strata sample total 
4. Calculate the within-strata variance of this total
5. Calculate the overall total and variance by summing these values across the strata.

# Using R

## Selecting a Stratified Random Sample

### Using the `strata` function from the `sampling` package

1.  Sort the data by the stratification variable

```{r}
agpop.sorted <- agpop %>% arrange(region)
```

2.  Specify the desired within-strata sample sizes $n_{k}$.

```{r}
n.k <- c(103, 21, 135, 41)
```

3.  Create the sampling index of records to select using the `strata` function with arguments specifying the strata names, strata size, and sampling method within strata.

```{r}
strat.idx <- sampling::strata(data = agpop.sorted, stratanames = "region", 
                    size = n.k, method = "srswor")
```

:warning: Package conflicts can occur with the `strata` function. If it is not working for you, use the `sampling::strata` method of calling the function to ensure you are using the correct version of the `strata` function from the `sampling` package.

4.  Extract the data records that correspond to the sampling index.

```{r}
ag.str <- getdata(agpop.sorted, strat.idx)
head(ag.str)
```

5.  Calculate the sampling weights using the inclusion probabilities (these were created as the variable `Prob` when you used the `strata` function)

```{r}
ag.str$wt <- 1/ag.str$Prob
head(ag.str)
```

5b. Check that the sampling weights sum to the stratum population sizes.

```{r}
ag.str %>% group_by(region) %>% summarize(sum.wts = sum(wt))
table(agpop.sorted$region)
```

### Warning

If the weights do not sum to the stratum population sizes, you have made a mistake somewhere in the calculations for the weights or strata sizes.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Computing Statistics from a Stratified Random Sample

### 1. Setup the information for the survey design.

#### a. Specify weights

We created the weights in the dataset in the the last step.

#### b. Specify fpc

We need to create a vector of fpc's that are equal to the strata population size. In a SRS, we used `fpc = rep(N,n)`. This create a vector that contains the value `N`, repeated `n` times. In this case, we need to match the strata population size to each record from that strata.

Option 1: Create a vector that repeats the values in the vector `N.k`, each `n.k` times.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
option1.fpc <- rep(N.k, n.k)
```

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
**Example on how to use the `rep` function**

```{r}
ex.N.k <- c(10,25,50) # example population sizes
ex.n.k <- c(2,5,10)   # example strata sizes
rep(ex.N.k, ex.n.k)   
```

The pop size for stratum 1 is repeated twice (the size of the sample from that stratum), the pop size for stratum 2 is repeated 5 times (the sample size for stat stratum) etc.
:::

Option 2: Merge the pop sizes onto the sample data using `region` as a joining key

```{r}
(pop.strata.sizes <- table(agpop.sorted$region) %>% data.frame())
pop.strata.sizes <- rename(pop.strata.sizes, region = Var1, popsize = Freq)
ag.str.opt2 <- ag.str %>% left_join(pop.strata.sizes)
```

### 2. Call `svydesign`

```{r}
agpop.str.dsgn <- svydesign(id = ~1, strata = ~region, weights = ~wt, 
                            fpc = ~popsize, 
                            # fpc = option1.fpc # This would be Option 1
                            data= ag.str.opt2)
```

### 3. Calculate total, SE and CI

Note the degrees of freedom for a CI under a stratified sample is $n-H$, which can be extracted from the `svydesign` object using the `degf` function.

```{r}
(str.total <- svytotal(~acres92, agpop.str.dsgn))
confint(str.total, level = .95, df = degf(agpop.str.dsgn))
```

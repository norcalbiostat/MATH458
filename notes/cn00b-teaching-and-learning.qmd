# Creating teaching materials (The "what")

## Approach to learning content {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Dr. D will create an outline of topics/sections to cover (Hack MD).
2.  Students will learn and teach the material to the whole class.
    a.  **Starter Notes**: Every student will do a pre-read of each section, and write starter notes using a set of guidelines (Canvas Discussion Board - individual grade)
    b.  **Jigsaw Lecture**: Using a randomized speaking rotation, students will share out verbally their notes for a section.
        -   Subsequently called on students will then add to, question, or modify those presented notes.
    c.  **Written Notes**: Students will work in (random-ishly assigned) subgroups of 3-4 people to generate written notes for to be posted on class website.
        - Individual students responsible for generating and submitting individual notes as in prior chapters. 
:::

## Working subgroups {.smaller}

[Working Subgroup assignment - Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Inj6xmMsoRcIHR5mpVShQisg5llXwesoDRuVRbvI5mY)

-   *Notes subgroup*: Compile the info from all starter notes into functional quarto format with callout boxes and clean formatting(Hack MD)
-   *Examples and YTI*: Convert book examples, figures and tables (as appropriate) to R/Quarto code and create "you try it" questions (with solutions)
-   *Revision subgroup*: Reviews entire set of notes, including examples and YTI for completeness and correctness.
-   *Exercises subgroup*: Review end of chapter exercises, choose (with approval by Dr. D) and write a solution for the listed sections below. These practice problems will be used to generate the homework assignment, and final exam questions.
    -   2 memorization questions
    -   2 discussion / concept questions
    -   1-2 application questions

## Dr. D will be responsible for... {.smaller}

-   Document, monitor, and enforce agreed upon ground rules
-   Set reasonable timelines for completion of work
-   Facilitate logistics of collaborative work activities (assign sections, rotate speaking order)
-   Setup and maintain collaborative documents, compile and post lecture notes to the class webpage, create worksheets and assignments based on submitted questions.
-   Cross-checking materials for accuracy and correctness
-   Setup Canvas module with items for: course notes (creating, presenting, submitting), practice worksheet, homework assignment.

# Inside-Outside (I-O) learning strategy (The "why")

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
The Inside-Outside learning strategy intends to emphasize the transformations: from inside to outside and from learning to teaching. [(Ref: Education 2.0: Student Generated Learning Materials through Collaborative Work)](data/Education%202_0.pdf)
:::

## I-O Strategy

In this learning strategy students do the following:

-   collaborate to create your own learning materials
-   develop memorization questionnaires, discussion topics and questions, summary tables, relation trees and other visualization aids.
-   develop specific problems and exercises that may be included in assessments such as homework or exams

Each learning item developed by students is peer-reviewed before being approved as a learning material.

## Everyone hates group work. - Or do they? {.smaller}

-   In college this often typically the case
-   Feelings of workload imbalance, lack of investment from partners, one person "having to do all the work".
-   Instructors will say "for your own good" because the workplace is collaborative
    -   True! But often you don't deal with free loaders
-   Small group think & collaborative effort always is better than individual efforts
-   Group success is achieved with mutual respect and agreed upon common ground rules.
    -   AKA social norms for the group

## Elements of Collaborative Learning

1.  Clearly Perceived Positive Interdependence
2.  Interaction
3.  Individual Accountability and Personal Responsibility
4.  Small Group Skills
5.  Group Processing

## Establishing Ground Rules

-   We will review each of the 5 aspects listed
-   For each aspect you are asked to state your personal opinion and suggestions [in this google form](https://forms.gle/5dbgp86EBXhNbFas8).
-   Sign in required (for participation credit), but response display is anonymous.
-   Dr. D will compile responses, share with the class, and draft a code of conduct for the class to review & revise.
-   As a class we will review responses and revise/sign the code of conduct.

## 1. Clearly Perceived Positive Interdependence {.smaller}

In collaborative learning the success of one person is bound up with the success of others. There are a few suggested ways to facilitate this dependency:

-   **Goal sharing**: shared subject matter, assessment, joint problem solving, creating or discovering something of value
-   **Role sharing**: Each member has specific roles & responsibilities that contribute to overall task
-   **Task interdependence**: Division of labor so one member has to complete their task before next member can start

::: callout-note
### I want to know...

Which of these methods would you like to see implemented? AND WHY?
:::

## 2. Interaction

There is an expectation that students will help each other so that common goals can be achieved. Help may be resources, advice, provision of feedback and challenging conclusions.

::: callout-note
### I want to know...

1.  What is an example of a positive/helpful interaction that will contribute to group learning.
2.  What is an example of a negative/unhelpful interaction that will hinder group learning
3.  What ground rules regarding person-to-person interaction that you would like the class to follow?
:::

## 3. Individual Accountability and Personal Responsibility

Everyone is expected to do their fair share of work and it is important for all group members to know that they cannot 'free ride.'

To ensure fairness in effort and responsibility, all graded work will be weighted according to your level of participation and engagement with the material as assessed by the instructor, and your peers.

::: callout-note
### I want to know...

How would you like to ensure accountability from yourself, and your peers?
:::

## 4. Small Group Skills {.smaller}

Interpersonal skills such as making decisions and solving conflicts are important. In order to achieve these goals students must:

-   Get to know and trust each other
-   Communicate clearly
-   Provide and accept support
-   Resolve conflict constructively

::: callout-note
### I want to know...

What do we mean by each of these? What do positive interpersonal skills look like to you? Provide an example of each listed above.
:::

## 5. Group Processing {.smaller}

Group work is effective when group participants reflect on how well they function as a group. This reflection assists members to maintain good working relationships.

Shared reflection can be used as a carrot ðŸ¥• - sharing positive feedback lets us know what we're doing that strengthen relationships. What should we keep doing.

And a stick ðŸŒ´- sharing critical feedback lets us know what we're doing that can harm relationships. Something we should work on changing or doing less of.

::: callout-note
### I want to know...

How would you suggest we collect and share personal reflections on the group as a whole, and specific individuals? What tools or techniques would you suggest?
:::

## Other concerns

You will also have the opportunity to share any additional concerns about this approach in the google survey form.

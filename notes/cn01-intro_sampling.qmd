# Introduction

The objective of sample surveys is to make inference about a population from information contained in a sample selected from that population. We are usually interested in estimating some population parameter such as the population mean, proportion or total.

# Populations and Representative Samples (1.2)

A sample is representative if it can be used to "reconstruct" what the population looks like and if we can provide an accurate assessment of how good that reconstruction is.

## Key Terms

Some definitions are needed to make the notions of a "population" and a "representative sample" more precise.

![Textbook Figure 1.1. Target population and sampled population in a telephone survey of registered voters.](../figs/fig1_1.png)

-   **Target Population**:
-   **Sampling frame**:  
-   **Observational Unit**: 
-   **Sample**: 
-   **Sampled population**: 
-   **Sampling unit**: 

In an *ideal* survey, the sampled population will be identical to the target population. ðŸ¦„

### :question: :busts_in_silhouette: Key Terms

In small groups go to our [collaborative notes](https://hackmd.io/@norcalbiostat/cn01-intro_sampling) and put your names in the `[names]` portion for one of the three examples that you are assigned to work on. Then as a group read the details for your example from the textbook and identify as many key terms as you can. 

_Suggestion: Only one person from each group should be doing the writing but everyone should be logged in and viewing._

# Selection Bias (1.3)

**Selection bias** occurs when the target population does not coincide with the sampled population because some population units are sampled at a different rate than intended by the investigator.

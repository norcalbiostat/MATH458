# Inside-Outside (I-O) learning strategy

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
The Inside-Outside learning strategy intends to emphasize the transformations: from inside to outside and from learning to teaching.
:::

In this learning strategy students do the following: 

* collaborate to create your own learning materials
* develop memorization questionnaires, discussion topics and questions, summary tables, relation trees and other visualization aids.
* develop specific problems and exercises that may be included in assessments such as homework or exams 

Each learning item developed by students is peer-reviewed before
being approved as a learning material.


# Elements of Collaborative Learning
Refer to page 1840 (pdf page 6) of the I-O strategy PDF. 

## 1. Clearly Perceived Positive Interdependence
In collaborative learning the success of one person is bound up with the success of others. There are a few suggested ways to facilitate this dependency: 

* Goal sharing
* Role sharing
* Task interdependence


## 2. Interaction

There is an expectation that students will help each other so that common goals can be achieved. Help may be resources, advice, provision of feedback and challenging conclusions. 

## 3. Individual Accountability and Personal Responsibility

Everyone is expected to do their fair share of work and it is important for all group members to know that they cannot 'free ride.'

## 4. Small Group Skills 

Interpersonal skills such as making decisions and solving conflicts are important. In order to achieve these goals students must:

* Get to know and trust each other
* Communicate clearly
* Provide and accept support
* Resolve conflict constructively

## 5. Group Processing

Group work is effective when group participants reflect on how well they function as a group. This reflection assists members to maintain good working relationships.


# Establishing Ground Rules and a "code of conduct"


# Methods for creating teaching material

1. Create an outline of topics to cover.
    - May not be every single section
2. Create a summary of each retained section
    - With an example to go over as a group
    - and a very similar example for individuals to try on their own
3.

## Dissemination tools

* Single quarto file with first level headers for each section
* Fully reproducible, packages and data read in at the top. 
*

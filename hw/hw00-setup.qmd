# 1. Discord

Click this link to join the Math & Stats Discord server [https://discord.gg/xCQTAgu8bE](https://discord.gg/xCQTAgu8bE). This is a support platform where student office hours will be held and personalized channels can be made.

## This is the defacto method of communication for this class
I get way too many emails that it's easy to miss one from you. Got questions about an assignment? Need help understanding a code error? Ask here and get help not just from me, but from your classmates as well. This is a collaborative not competitive class.
:::

a. [Download the Desktop app](https://discord.com/download). <span style="color:red">**You should not rely on remembering to log in using the web version.**</span> Chances are very high that you will miss out on important announcements and bonus activities. There also is a Discord phone app that you may want to consider. 
b. You are welcome to have any username you choose as long as it's suitable for school. 
c. Once you join the server and accept the code of conduct, go to the `#class-selection` channel (left side bar) and click the icon that'll add you to our class folder. 
d. Post an introduction in the `#458-class-chat` channel. Include the following:
    * major
    * Any pets (include pics!)
    * what fictional family would you like to belong to? 
    * your biggest concern about the class

# 2. Update your R (4.2+) and R Studio (latest). 

* All homework is to be done in a literate programming/reproducible manner. This means either `.Rmd` or `.qmd` files compiled to PDF. 
    - If you don't know what this means, review lecture 02 & 03 from [Math 130 week 1](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/wk1.html)
    - While Rmarkdown is great and still fine to use, you may want to consider learning about the next generation of literate programming tools: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
* Make sure you can knit to PDF. If you cannot, then install the `tinytex` package and then run `tinytex::install_tinytex()` in the console to install a lightweight version of LaTeX.
    

# 3. Get Organized

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **reports**.

You need to choose a naming convention for your folders and try to stick with it. Recommended options are: 

* ALL CAPS (MATH458)
* no caps (math458)
* snake_case (math_458) 
* CamelCase (Math458) 

Create this class folder along with the following subfolders to organize your data and script files.

* `data` - any data that's handed out goes in here
* `worksheets` - scripts used for completing worksheets 
* `homework`- assignments to be submitted
* `notes` - you will be writing and contributing notes to the class
* `exams` - because they're likely to be computer based.

## Do not let everything live in your downloads folder.
This means when you download a file, right click and "Save as" or "Save target as" and **actively choose** where to download this file.

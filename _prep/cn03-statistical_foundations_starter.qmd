# Introduction

In this section we review the basic concepts underlying the selection of an estimator of a population parameter, the method for evaluating its goodness, and the concepts involved in interval estimation. Because the bias and the variance of estimators determine their goodness, we need to review the basic ideas concerned with the expectation and variance of a random variable.

## Populations and Samples

Statistical inference centers around using information from a sample to understand what might be true about the entire population of interest. If all we see are the data in the sample, what conclusions can we draw about the population? How sure are we about the accuracy of those conclusions? 

On April 29, 2011, Prince William married Kate Middleton in London. The Pew Research Center reports that 34% of US adults watched some or all of the royal wedding. How do we know that 34% of all US adults watched? Did anyone ask **you** if you watched it? In order to know for sure what proportion of US adults watched the wedding, we would need to ask **all** US adults whether or not they watched. This would be very difficult to do. As we will see, however, we can estimate the _population_ proportion _parameter_ quite accurately with a _sample statistic_, as long as we use a random sample. In the case of the royal wedding, the estimate is based on a poll using a random sample of 1006 US adults.


* _Statistical inference_: 
* _Parameter_: 
* _Statistic_: 

Generally our goal is to know the value of the population parameter exactly but this usually isn't possible since we usually cannot collect information from the entire population. 

Instead we can select a sample from the population, calculate the quantity of interest for the sample, and use this sample statistic to estimate the value for the whole population.

The US Census states that 27.5% of US adults who are at least 25 years old have a college bachelor's degree or higher. Suppose that in a random sample  of $n$=200 US residents who are 25 or older, 58 of them have a college bachelor's degree or higher. 

What is the population parameter? What is the sample statistic? Use correct notation for your answer.

After we have a little more mathematical terminology and foundation, we'll come back to what we mean by "best estimate", and examine how we can determine if something is a "good" estimate.

where the summation is over all the values of $y$ for which $p(y)>0$.  
$p(y)$ is the probability of each value of $y$.

:::{.callout-important}
### Definition: Population Variance & Standard Deviation

$$\sigma^{2} = V(y)=E(y-\mu)^{2} = \sum_{y}\left(y-\mu\right)^{2}*p(y)$$

The variability of measurements in a population can be measured by the **variance** which is defined as the average squared deviation from the mean between a randomly selected measurement $\_$ and its mean value $\_$


The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance, and is denoted $\_$.

Sometimes it's may be convenient to calculate the variance using this formulation: 

$$ $$
:::


We can also calculate these measurements directly from the sample measurements. 

In statistical studies, the population of interest consists of _unknown_ measurements; hence, we can only speculate on the relative frequencies ($p(y)$). In order to gain information about a population we take a sample of $n$, $y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{n}$. We can then infer characteristics about the population. Given our sample data, $y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{n}$, we can calculate the mean and variance:

$$\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}$$
$$s^{2} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum^{n}_{i=1}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}$$

:question: Why do we have $n-1$ in the denominator for $s^2$, but only $n$ in the denominator for $\bar{y}$?

When a few data points are repeated in a data set, the results are often arrayed in a frequency table. For example, a quiz given to each of 25 students was graded on a four-point scale (0,1,2,3), 3 being a perfect score. 

Consider the following results: 16 students scored a 3, 4 students scored a 2, 2 students scored a 1, and 3 scored a 0. Assume this distribution of scores is representative of the population distribution. 

Calculate both the sample and population values of the average and standard deviation. 
:::

Here is some starter code. 
```{r}
y <- 3:0
f <- c(16, 4, 2, 3)
p <- c(.64, .16, .08, .12)
dta <- rep(y, f)
```

## The Finite Population Case (Lohr Ch 2.2)

The previous section develops results for random sampling from a population considered to be infinite. In such situations, each sampled element has the same chance of being selected and the selections are independent of one another. 

* Most sampling problems don't live in an infinite world, but the population is usually finite although it may be quite large. 
* In addition, we may want to take into consideration varying the probabilities with which the units are sampled. 

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
### Example: Estimate total number of job openings. 
Suppose, for example, we want to estimate the total number of job openings in a city by sampling industrial firms from within that city. Many of these firms will be small and a few firms will be large. In a random sample _of firms_, the size of the firm is not taken into account. However, the number of job openings will be directly dependent on the size of the firm. Thus, we might improve the sample if large firms are more likely to be included in the sample. 
:::

* Suppose the population consists of the set of elements $\{u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{N}\}$ and a sample of $n$ elements is to be selected with replacement independently of one another.
* Let $\{\delta_{1},\delta_{2},...,\delta_{N}\}$ represent the respective probabilities of selection for the population elements. 
    - $\delta_{i}$ is 
    - for the case of random sampling with replacement, each $\delta_{i} = $

[Note: The mathematical definition of unbiased is not the same thing as selection biased discussed earlier. The math definition of bias will be discussed below.]{.aside}
An **unbiased estimator** of the population total, $\tau$, is given by

$$
\hat{\tau}=\frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}\frac{y_{i}}{\delta_{i}}
$$

When $\delta_{i} = 1/N$, we can rewrite this as 

$$
\hat{\tau} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}\frac{y_{i}}{(1/N)} = \frac{N}{n} \sum^{n}_{i=1}y_{i} = N\bar{y}
$$

It is in the best interest to select the $\delta_{i}$ values in such a way that the _______ is as small as possible. The best practical way to choose the $\delta_{i}$ is to choose them proportional to a known measurement that is highly correlated with $y_{i}$. 

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
### Example: Job openings cont. 
Our universe only consists of these $N=4$ firms: A, B, C and D. 

| Firm | Jobs ($x$) | Size of firm | $\delta_{i}$ |
|------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| A    | 3          | 70           | 70/580       |
| B    | 10         | 90           | 90/580       |
| C    | 25         | 120          | 120/580      |
| D    | 61         | 300          | 300/580      |
:::

The population total of job openings is $\tau= 99$. But of course we don't know this, so we want to take a sample of $n=2$ firms and count the number of jobs at each firm $x$ as a way to estimate this total. 

If all firms have equal probability of being selected, then the subset of firms $\{A, B\}$ have the same chance of being selected as any other subset of two firms such as $\{A, C\}$. However, we may want to select firms with probabilities in proportion to their workforce ($\delta_{i}$).  

Without adjustment the estimate of the total job openings based on the $\{A, B\}$ sample would be: 
$$
\hat{\tau} = N\bar{X} = 
$$


If we adjust $y_{i}$ based on the probability of selecting firms A and B,
$$
\hat{\tau} = \frac{.}{.}\Big[\frac{.}{./.} + \frac{.}{./.}\Big]  = 
$$

# Variability of Estimates

### :question: :busts_in_silhouette: Turn and talk
Why do we usually think of a parameter $\mu$ or $p$ as a fixed value, while the sample statistic $\bar{x}$ or $\hat{p}$ as a random variable?
:::

Along with the point estimate we also want to know how accurate we can expect the point estimate to be. In other words, if we took another random sample of the same size from the population, is the point estimate from this new sample likely to be similar to the first point estimate or are they likely to be far apart.

### Example: Enrollment in Graduate Programs in Statistics
Graduate programs in statistics often pay their graduate students, which means that many graduate students in statistics are able to attend graduate school tuition free with an assistantship or fellowship. There are 82 US statistics doctoral programs for which enrollment data were available. The data set `StatisticsPhD` lists all these schools together with the total enrollment of full-time graduate students in each program in 2009.

:question: What is the average full-time graduate student enrollment in US statistics doctoral programs in 2009?

```{r}
stat.phd <- readr::read_csv(here::here("___", "_______"))
head(stat.phd)
mean(stat.phd$_______)

Based on the data set, the mean enrollment in 2009 is ____ full-time graduate students. Because this is the mean for the entire population of all US statistics doctoral programs for which data were available that year, we have that $\mu=$ students.

Knowing the behavior of of repeated sample statistics (like the mean in the prior example) is critically important. Let's dig into this a little more by repeating this sampling experiment many times. 

```{r}
many.means <- replicate(n=_____, {
  my.sample.programs <- sample(stat.phd$FTGradEnrollment, size=10)
  mean(my.sample.programs)
})
```

Let's visualize the distribution of all those sample means.

[The proof of the CLT is generally seen in a first graduate Statistics class that uses convergence in distribution concepts from MATH 420.]{.aside}
In elementary statistics you were introduced to the "Central Limit Theorem" (CLT). The CLT states that the sampling distribution of $\bar{y}$ should be centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation of $\sigma/n$. It also states that the shape of the distribution should be approximately Normal for a large $n$.

# Properties of Estimators

In general, suppose that $\hat{\theta}$ is an estimator of the parameter $\theta$. Two properties that we would like $\hat{\theta}$ to have are

1. The estimate is **unbiased**: 
2. The estimate is **precise**: 

To clarify: 

* **Measurement bias** means that the $y$'s are measured inaccurately. 
    - That means an estimator of a total $t$ calculated as $\hat{t} = \sum_{i \in U} y_{i}$ where $U$ is the entire universe, then $\hat{t}$ itself would not be the true total of interest. 
    - Trying to estimate heights of students, but your ruler is always off 3 cm
* **Estimation bias** means that the estimator chosen resulted in a bias. 
    - If we calculated the total as $t' = \sum_{i \in L} y_{i}$ from a random sample of $L$ units in the universe, $\hat{t'}$ would be biased. 
    - Trying to estimate heights of students by taking a sample of the shorter students only.

If two unbiased estimators are available for $\theta$ we generally prefer the one with the smaller variance.

Because sometimes we use biased estimators, we often use the _______ instead of the variance to estimate the **_____________**. 

:::{.callout-important}
### Definition: Bias, Variance, Accuracy
$$\mbox{Bias}(\hat{\theta}) = E(\hat{\theta}) - \theta$$

$$V(\hat{\theta})  = E \Big[(\hat{\theta} - E[\hat{\theta}])^2\Big]$$

$$\mbox{MSE}(\hat{\theta}) = V(\hat{\theta}) + [Bias(\hat{\theta})]^2$$

* A is **_____________**. The average position of all arrows is at the center of the target.
* B is **_____________** but not unbiased. All arrows are close together but systematically away from the center.

### Example
Suppose probability samples of size $n=2$ are selected from the list `c(1,2,3,4)`, with $\delta_{i}$ probabilities `c(.4, .4, .1, .1)`. Demonstrate that $\hat{\tau}$ is an unbiased estimator of the population total $\tau$, but its variance is 81.25.

Initial problem setup: Define data/sample/known values as objects in R.  
```{r}
x <- 1:4
deltas <- c(.4,.4,.1,.1)
(tau <- sum(x))
```

Create all possible samples of size $n=2$, and add the probability of selection for that sample. 

```{r}
# Create all possible samples of size 2


# Add the selection probabilities 

```
[An alternative method of creating the universe is to create separate vectors `x1 <- rep(x,4); x2 <- rep(x, each=4)`.]{.aside}
Note the resulting object is a table/matrix with 16 rows and 4 columns, where each row is a possible sample of $n=2$ from the universe. 

Now calculate $\hat{\tau} = \frac{1}{2}\Big[\frac{x_1}{\delta_1} + \frac{x_2}{\delta_2}\Big]$. 

```{r}

```

_manually verify calculation_
```{r}

```


Now calculate $E[\hat{\tau}] = \sum \hat{\tau}*p(\hat{\tau})$ and $V[\hat{\tau}] = E[\hat{\tau}] - E[\hat{\tau}]^2]$, where $p(\hat{\tau}) = \delta_1*\delta_2$ is the probability that sample is chosen.

# Interval Estimation 

In general, it is usually not enough to just give a point estimate when estimating a population parameter. Why?

> 

## Bounds on Estimators

The objective of sampling is to estimate the population parameters, such as the mean or the total of a population from information contained in the sample. The experimenter controls the quantity of information by choosing an appropriate sample size. How can we determine how many sampling units to select? 

> 

Suppose that we are trying to estimate some parameter $\theta$ using the sample estimator $\hat{\theta}$. We want the value of _________ to be small. We refer to the value of _________ as the **error** because it is the difference between the _________ value and the _________ value. 

:::{.callout-note appearance=minimal}
### :question: :busts_in_silhouette: Turn & talk

What is the difference between the _error_ and _bias_?
:::


We might want to specify that the absolute value of the error is less than some number, say $B$. Thus,
$$
\mbox{Error of Estimation}=|\theta-\hat{\theta}|<B
$$

We should also define a probability ($1-\alpha$) such that our error is less than $B$ if we were to take repeated samples. 
$$
P\left(|\theta-\hat{\theta}|<B\right)=1-\alpha
$$

We will often select $B$ to be approximately ______________________ of $\hat{\theta}$, ______________________. As we saw earlier in @ref(#sampling-distribution), many of the statistics that we will discuss exhibit a normal sampling distribution even when the population distribution is skewed.


## Standard Error

:::{.callout-important}
### Definition: Standard Error
The _standard error_ of a statistic is ...  
:::


The standard error of a statistic tells us how much the sample statistic will vary from sample to sample. In situations like above where we can examine the distribution of the sample statistic using simulation, we can estimate the standard error by taking the sample standard deviation of the sampling distribution. In other situations we can use closed form mathematical formulas to calculate the standard error.

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
### Example Grad program example cont. 
Estimate the standard error for the mean enrollment in statistics PhD programs for a sample size of 10 and also a sample size of 20. 
:::

```{r}
sd(many.means) # where did this come from?

```


## Confidence Intervals

When the distributions are relatively symmetric and bell-shaped, the 95% rule tells us that approximately 95% of the data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Applying the 95% rule to sampling distributions, we see that about 95% of the sample statistics will fall within two standard errors of the mean. We use this rule many times to form what we call an approximate 95% confidence interval which gives us a range for which which we are quite confident that captures the true parameter we are trying to estimate.

When using a formula to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval, use $2*SE$ as the margin of error.

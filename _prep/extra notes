# The Design of the Sample Survey

Since the objective of sampling is to estimate the population parameters, such as the mean or the total of a population from information contained in the sample. The experimenter controls the quantity of information by choosing an appropriate sample size. How do we determine which sampling procedure to use and how many sampling units to sample?


> It depends on the magnitude of the error that we find acceptable.


Suppose that we are trying to estimate some parameter $\theta$ from our sample. $\hat{\theta}$ is what we will call the statistic that is used to estimate $\theta$. Thus, we will use $\hat{\theta}$ as an estimate of $\theta$. Therefore, we will want the value of $\theta-\hat{\theta}$ to be **small**. 

We call the value of $\theta-\hat{\theta}$ the **error** because it is the difference between the estimated value and the true value.

A major objective in Statistics is to minimize error.

We might want to specify that the absolute value of the error is less than some number, say $B$. Thus,

$$
\mbox{Error of Estimation}=|\theta-\hat{\theta}|<B
$$

We should also state a probability ($1-\alpha$) that our error is less than $B$ if we were to take repeated samples. This is stated as

$$
P(\mbox{Error of Estimation}=|\theta-\hat{\theta}| < B) = 1-\alpha
$$

We will often select $B$ to be approximately 2 times the standard deviation of $\hat{\theta}$, $B=2\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}$. Many of the statistics that we will discuss exhibit a normal sampling distribution even when the population distribution is skewed.

## Types of sampling methods
We will go into the different types of sampling methods throughout the class, but here are a few. 

### Probability Sampling

The classical formulation of a statistical estimation problem requires that randomness be brought into the sampling plan. With proper randomness in the sampling scheme we can be sure that we have an unbiased estimate and that our statements that involve our confidence in the estimate are accurate. Sampling designs based on planned randomness are called **probability samples**.

### Simple random sample
There are two types of simple random sampling. One is simple random sampling _with_ replacement, whereby a member of the population can be selected more than once; the other is simple random sampling _without_ replacement,whereby a member of the population can be selected at most once. 

> Unless otherwise specified, we assume that sampling is done without replacement. 

### Stratified sampling

Often deployed when we want to guarantee representation from different groups (strata) in the population. In stratified sampling the population is first divided into subpopulations, called _strata_, and then sampling is done from each stratum. Ideally the members of the subpopulations should be homogeneous relative to the characteristic under consideration.

### Example: Would taxpayors support a neighborhood pool?

For instance, suppose that a city planner is interested in finding out how his town would feel about a new public pool being built funded by tax payer dollars. He might divide the population up into different income groups such as high, middle, and low incomes. He would then  take a simple random sample of individuals within each strata (income group). This would guarantee that his sample had representation from all income groups.

Note that this type of sampling plan makes use of an auxiliary variable, in this case income. By stratifying we should be increasing the accuracy of our estimate.
